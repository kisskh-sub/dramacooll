00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.930
This won't work.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.370
"Laughter in the Vast Sea?"

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.390
"Laughter in the vast sea;
tides surging on both shores."

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.430
"Drifting with the waves,
living only for today."

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.280
"The people laugh, no longer lonely."

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.870
"The passion remains in foolish laughter."

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.640
Who's there?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.250
Who's there?

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.630
Sancai.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.110
Swordsman Sancai.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.240
You...

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.079
W-Who are you?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.450
What do you want?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.320
Let me ask you.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.150
Back when you were
homeless on the streets,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.290
were you saved by a mysterious man?

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.760
How do you know that?

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.680
Because I was that mysterious man.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.610
How can you prove it?

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.200
When we parted ways,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.920
I left you a secret code for recognition.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.120
Secret code?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.780
"Spring sleep knows no dawn."

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.310
"Mosquitoes bite me everywhere."

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.040
"When I roll over in the night…"

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.310
"Countless get crushed to death."

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.490
You're truly the man

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.000
who saved me back then.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.730
He's really Swordsman Sancai.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.510
In the original novel,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.630
there were three music enthusiasts
skilled in rhythm.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.480
I thought three was too many,
so I merged them into one.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.630
Then I made him an undercover agent
in the Power Gang,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.040
a loyal guy who provided information
to the protagonists.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.270
Unexpectedly, the system was destroyed,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.930
but this character remained.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.180
Alright, alright.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.560
I forgot. May I ask your name?

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.120
I'm Xiao Qiushui.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.040
You're Xiao Qiushui?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.630
Hold on.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.750
Didn't you say you do good deeds
without leaving your name?

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.810
Why are you telling me who you are now?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.270
Did I say that?

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.159
I understand now.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.720
My sincerity must have moved the heavens.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.040
That's why you were sent to me,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.630
right?

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.110
You know what?

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.480
Since we parted last time,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.360
I've felt like I was waiting for someone

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.040
to kickstart my life's mission.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.310
And somehow I felt that person was you.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.159
So,

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.190
I've been playing music nonstop.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.360
Finally, you showed up.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
How wonderful!

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.630
However,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.360
there's one more thing.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.510
I always feel

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.920
there's another world beyond ours.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.310
Actually,
I really want someone to confide in,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.040
but no one here understands me.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.530
For example,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.480
in my mind,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.680
I keep hearing melodies like this.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.680
Stop singing.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.270
You sing quite well,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.159
and it sounds somewhat familiar.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.190
Come and sit.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.190
-You…
-Come and sit.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.000
So you've heard it too!

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.270
I knew it.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.070
You didn't just save my life

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.640
but truly understand me.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.250
Oh, right, there's one more line.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.800
It's been ringing in my head like thunder,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.180
so full of emotion.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.690
But I've never understood what it means.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.480
What line?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.960
Drink slowly.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.800
Screw the 9-to-6 grind!

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.310
I don't want to do this job
for another day!

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.330
What...

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.720
What does it mean?

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.190
This line
is

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.310
packed with emotion.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.800
Only someone with certain life experiences
can understand it.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.270
You can't comprehend it yet.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.870
I see.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.690
I really hope one day

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.390
I can have
such unique life experiences too.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.480
Oh, one more thing.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.600
I've never dared to tell anyone about it.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.360
I always feel

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.510
that this world is a huge book.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.210
That's what you think?

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.310
Do you think this idea of mine is crazy?

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.240
You know what? Whenever I fall asleep,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.770
all kinds of weird words
flash before my eyes.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.430
Oh, one time,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.050
I saw a passage that said

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.510
you went to the Golden Summit
of the Emei Sect

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.600
and became the unparalleled

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.720
and revered Martial Arts Alliance Leader.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.120
And me? I was standing beside you,
serving you tea.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.950
No, I mean, handing you your armor.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.190
You shouted 8 words:

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.390
"I'm invincible in Shenzhou,
yet lonely as snow."

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.549
Isn't that the scene I once wrote?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.929
Why do you think I saw that passage?

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.789
Could it really be like
that old physician said—

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:39.840
that I'm sick?

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.669
Listen, don't overthink it.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.200
Don't make assumptions,
and don't get nervous.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.600
Come, sit down.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.840
I'll tell you why.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.130
I'm so thirsty.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.750
Oh, my god.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.130
What am I saying?

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960
According to what you said,

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.870
another world is affecting this one.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.910
You gave me the ability to foresee things,

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.510
so I know some future events.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.270
But you entered this world

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.670
and became Xiao Qiushui,

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.960
changing parts of the storyline.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.440
So what I've foreseen
is no longer accurate.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.070
That's right.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.450
So now, you're not just
an undercover agent in the Power Gang

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.510
but also my trusted partner.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.270
Because I created you,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.270
your mind

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.750
holds information from another world.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.910
But in my memory,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.530
information from the other world

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.600
is getting less and less.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.360
It's okay.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.720
You have me.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.520
I'll help you figure things out.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.480
You made me such a great

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.790
and important man,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.440
but I left you in this world

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.700
to bear all this alone.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.150
I really hate myself

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.280
for not finding you sooner to help you.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.870
So what do we do next?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.410
I need to find the Power Gang first.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.150
What a coincidence!

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.870
I'm an undercover agent in the Power Gang.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.440
I've been lying low for so long,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.240
never knowing what I was doing.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.000
I've been itching to make a big move.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.290
From now on,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.030
we'll see each other

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.320
as brothers.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.850
Whatever you need,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.910
just say the word.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.600
Okay.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.320
Sancai.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.960
Come here.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.210
Is that okay?

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.200
Great idea!

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.240
What should I do?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.240
We're going

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.000
to bring something to that old fox.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.390
That's easy.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.830
What are we bringing?

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.270
A corpse.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.840
C-Cor…

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.960
I didn't give you great lightness skill.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.960
Don't fly around recklessly again.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.230
Thank you.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.290
Sword King,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.960
this man was lurking outside the mansion,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.120
caught by the guards.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.510
He's at your mercy.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.080
Get Liu Suifeng here.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.870
Xiao Qiushui,
you've restored your meridians?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.320
Cut the crap.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.960
Since I've restored my meridians,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.750
I'll kill all of you someday.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.870
You actually came to my turf
to look for Liu Suifeng.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.960
Your turf?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.370
Don't tell me the Power Gang

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.530
is so broke that you only
have one meeting point left.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.790
Hurry up.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.150
Hand over Liu Suifeng's man to me.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.150
You think Liu Suifeng's man is here?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
Stop pretending.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.440
If you won't hand him over,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.270
I don't mind tearing this place down.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.870
This is my residence.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.870
You just said

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.460
Liu Suifeng's man is here.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.320
What does he look like?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.080
What does he look like? Ordinary-looking.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.960
He wears the same clothes as they do.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.760
Xiao Qiushui,

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.480
I haven't settled
the Guangling score with you yet.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.880
Indeed, we haven't settled our scores yet.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.960
I followed Liu Suifeng

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.000
and saw him secretly give a map

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.400
to someone in this house.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.780
Or I wouldn't have followed him here.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.790
What map?

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.870
Will you hand him over or not?

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.230
You can draw it for me.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.080
Perhaps we can talk.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:00.840
Move.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.870
I was too far away.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.400
Something like this.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.120
What did you draw?

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.130
I've never seen anything like it.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.030
I get it.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.650
Liu Suifeng can freely

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.550
enter and leave your residence

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.120
without you noticing.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.810
Never mind.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.200
There's no point asking you for him.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.910
I'm leaving.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:54.720
Xiao Qiushui.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.880
Don't think I don't know
what you're up to.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.080
You hate the Power Gang,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.960
so you're deliberately sowing discord.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.630
You keep saying
you only want to kill Liu Suifeng.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.230
Don't you want to kill me too?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.150
I do want to kill you.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.920
But compared to Liu Suifeng,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.010
who slaughtered my entire family,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.580
the grudge I have against you is nothing.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.350
So you want Liu Suifeng dead?

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.840
That's quite ambitious.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
For me,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.600
it's indeed difficult.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.440
But with your help,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.730
it might not be impossible.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.320
Liu Suifeng has planted
his men around you.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.750
If I were you,

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.440
I couldn't stand it.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.320
They say the Sword King is
the head of the Eight Kings.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.790
And yet

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.330
you let some upstart overshadow you.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.320
If I were you,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.540
I'd seek to take his place.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.850
How presumptuous!

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.480
You're nothing but a stray dog now,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.240
powerless and mediocre in martial arts.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.040
You can't even defeat my guards.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.510
What makes you think you can work with me?

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.370
My martial skills may be average,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.670
but I'm quite smart.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.400
I have no power or influence now,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.150
but don't you want the Hero Command Token?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.510
Why don't you consider working with me?

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.650
What do you say?

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.180
So you do have the Hero Command Token.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.550
That cunning Liu Suifeng

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.080
was watching you all along.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.460
If you really had it,
how could he not have found out?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.880
If you want to make a deal,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.360
show it to me first.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.670
You think I'm still that stupid?

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.240
If I take it out now,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.720
I'd be handing it over for nothing.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.010
How about this?

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.910
I can

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.120
tell you a secret first.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.370
On the Hero Command Token,

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.120
there are the fingerprints of the leaders

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.870
of the Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei Sects.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.910
Very few

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.440
in the martial world know this.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.570
Does he really have the token?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.080
Just help me kill Liu Suifeng.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.360
Once it's done,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.030
I'll give it to you.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.250
You'd really give it to me?

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.000
I'm the one who once tried to kill you

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.600
and severed your meridians.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.670
You crippled me,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.230
and I exposed your identity.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.920
What happened in Guangling

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.480
made me realize

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.069
that I couldn't make the best use

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.030
of the Hero Command Token,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.520
and it only brought me disaster.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.880
My parents

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.750
died because of it too.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.680
Help me kill Liu Suifeng.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.680
Once it's done,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.020
the Hero Command Token will be yours.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.200
Master,

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.960
we found Kang Chuyu.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.040
Bring him in.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.450
I'm afraid you have to come out.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.800
Who did this?

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.350
The body's badly decayed.
It's hard to tell the wounds.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.590
We found this on him.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.030
A Death Beetle?

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.480
Let the Death Beetle found on Mr. Qiu

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.960
give you one more push.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.200
The Eight Kings and above
all use golden Death Beetles.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.200
Ordinary Death Beetles like this

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.550
are only used to control spies
planted in different sects.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.210
How did it end up on Kang Chuyu?

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.740
Besides Chief,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.460
only Liu Suifeng
can control Death Beetles.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.350
And he's always targeted you,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.680
messing with our plans.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.070
He must have used the Death Beetle
without permission

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.330
to control Kang Chuyu,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.830
stealing our secrets.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.440
If he discovers that we...

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:36.950
Looks like we have to kill Liu Suifeng
as soon as possible.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.640
But the Misery Pill

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.750
in your body is still active.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.400
It's such a headache.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.750
It must be dealt with.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:46.680
Sword King,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.640
you need to think this through

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920
and make up your mind quickly.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.980
If you're too late,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.480
the Hero Command Token

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.200
will be taken by Suifeng.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.080
I can cooperate with you,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.590
but before that,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.920
you must prove yourself worthy.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.070
If you can't,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.830
you're of no use to me.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.400
How should I prove it?

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.510
Go to the Ghost King's stronghold
in Yimen Town

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.840
to get something for me.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.510
Fang,

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.750
there's been a lot on your mind lately.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.000
Are you…

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.280
thinking about Qiushui?

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.440
Father, I...

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.310
I can see

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.530
how you feel about that boy.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.550
I don't want to stop you.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.920
But what matters most now

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.180
is the future of our branch of the family.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.440
The third branch has been eyeing
the master's position.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:31.510
And I am

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.200
held back by old injuries.
There's not much I can do.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.920
Father,

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.530
please don't say that.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.750
Once I find the "Voidheart Codex,"

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.080
you'll surely recover.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.920
Actually,

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.920
I don't just want

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.370
the "Voidheart Codex" to heal my wounds.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.960
I want it so I can protect myself,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.640
our branch of the family,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.880
and you, Fang.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.380
Father!

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.110
I understand.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.600
Let's go back.
It's time for your medicine.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.960
All right.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:36.510
Father!

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.940
What are you doing?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.180
My father's been nothing but kind to you.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.480
Why are you betraying him?

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:22.110
I...

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.270
Are you forced to do this?

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.440
I-I can't tell you.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.030
I failed Master,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.680
but I couldn't control myself.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.790
I'm in so much pain.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.000
I don't want to live like this.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.750
Death Beetle?

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.880
Father.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.330
You recognize this bug?

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.160
The Power Gang's infamous Misery Pills

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.300
are made from this kind of bug.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.130
No wonder Mr. Li was acting strangely.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.700
But the Tang Sect is tightly guarded.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.460
How did the Power Gang
get this thing in here?

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.670
It must be Tang Song's doing.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.480
Thanks to your clever plan,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.680
the Sword King now

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.410
suspects everyone around him.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.510
He's on high alert.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.480
He only sent you to the Ghost King.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.740
But he doesn't fully trust me either.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.170
I feel he doesn't really want
to kill Liu Suifeng.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.640
He's just temporarily aligned with me.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.070
So,

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.200
we might as well
turn his plan against him.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.680
You're so clever.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.270
But if you had made me

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.310
a bit smarter,

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.310
I'd be even more help now.

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:10.200
Sancai,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.720
you're already a master of music

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.030
and know so much
about the past and future.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.690
You're already
an excellent undercover agent.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.970
Think about it.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.640
If a character

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.070
only had strengths,

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.640
that would be so boring.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.170
So you're actually
quite adorable as you are.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.200
Really?

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.310
You're right.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.680
Qiushui,

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.640
thank you for making me
such a good character.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.320
By the way,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.590
the Sword King wants me
to get the Death Beetle King for him.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.790
Do you know what it is?

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.480
It's vital to the Eight Kings.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.200
If the Sword King gets it,

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.200
he won't have to fear Liu Suifeng anymore

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.530
and can kill him at will.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.640
That's very crucial.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.640
But the Ghost King has a twisted taste.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.640
He likes

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.410
to keep living people in coffins
as beetle feed.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.310
His base

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.770
is known as the Coffin Den.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.790
If we go to the coffin shops
in Yimen Town,

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.450
we'll surely find his traces.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.880
Rumor has it that the Ghost King is
paranoid and vigilant.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.000
Too many people
would arouse his suspicion.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.790
This thing works really well.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.510
It can make

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.720
even the toughest guy do as told.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:39.430
This is the last one left.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.170
Don't worry.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.550
Ghost King has plenty of them.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.600
By the way,

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.790
did you finish what I told you to do?

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.990
Everything's ready.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.840
Let's go.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.830
Stop crying.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.360
Don't seal the coffins.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.880
Ghost King wants them alive.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.350
Yes.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.840
Let's go.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.730
What are you doing here?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.530
I'm here to find Ghost King.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.510
Mr. Tang.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.720
Miss Tang.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:37.600
Miss Song.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.110
Why does the Ghost King
suddenly need so much feed?

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.920
Many of the Death Beetle King's eggs

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.160
have lost their vitality lately.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.820
It urgently needs
human blood for nourishment.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.310
But that's only a temporary fix.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.350
To recover fully,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.830
it has to be taken
to the place Master mentioned

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.230
for proper nourishment.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.600
By the way,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.830
the Power Gang
killed some traitors a few days ago.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.070
I heard

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.880
Deputy Chief Liu and the Blade King
joined forces to kill the Fire King.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.880
Even your mysterious Chief Li

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.480
and his wife showed up.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.730
Is that true?

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.840
You're well-informed.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.160
If you ask me,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.790
with Deputy Chief Liu's unparalleled
martial arts skills,

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.120
he could have dealt with

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.770
the Fire King himself.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.590
Why make such a fuss?

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.110
Don't tell me the Power Gang

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.000
prefers extravagant methods.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.330
What do you know?

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.930
Killing a king isn't that simple.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.590
Each of the Eight Kings
has their own agenda.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.250
Without checks and balances,

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.070
the gang would've fallen into chaos.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.800
I'm curious.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.160
How does Chief Li keep the Eight Kings

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.590
and Deputy Chief Liu
at peace with each other?

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.160
Rumor has it
that the Eight Kings and above

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.440
have all been implanted
with a Misery Pill.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.330
Could it be true?

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.830
The best leverage against someone

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.200
is their own life.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.110
So if they try to harm others,

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.440
they'll die themselves?

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.750
How dare you pry
into the Power Gang's secrets?

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.920
Do you have a death wish?

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.550
Please don't be angry, Miss Song.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.110
My sister didn't mean
to probe your secrets.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.830
We all serve Master

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.360
with absolute loyalty.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.110
There truly are no secrets in this world.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.960
The Death Beetle King
that controls the Misery Pills

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.830
was raised with the blood

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.030
of Chief and Shirong.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.550
It only obeys those two.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.240
Even if others know this secret,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.040
it's useless.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.680
So don't waste your time scheming.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.280
So that's the purpose
of the Death Beetle King.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.590
Miss Song, you misunderstood.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.310
We were just concerned
about Deputy Chief Liu's safety.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.720
Since he's safe and sound,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.590
we can rest easy.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.550
However, if anything happens

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.950
to the Death Beetle King,

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.070
all the Death Beetles raised from its eggs

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.440
will become ineffective.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.100
Therefore,

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.550
if you want to keep controlling
those people in the Tang Sect,

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.750
you must ensure
the Death Beetle King goes there on time

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.880
to be nourished by nature's energy.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.690
Understood.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.640
I'll see to it.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.410
Master has already set out.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.480
We should go too.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.070
Yes.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.550
Yes.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.000
The Ghost King is unfathomable.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.330
Don't come any further.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.850
Deputy Chief, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.590
That reckless new leader
of the Xiaoyao Sect

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.480
actually dared to provoke the Power Gang.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.070
Deputy Chief,

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:49.640
can you guess

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.680
where he is now?

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.290
Ghost King, you're in the mood for games.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:02.720
But what matters now

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.130
is bringing the Death Beetle King out.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.880
It's weak at the moment.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.480
You need to be extra careful.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.190
I'm keeping a close eye on it.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.680
Deputy Chief, there's no need to worry.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.010
I smell living people.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.110
Deputy Chief, take a rest.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.750
I'll take the Death Beetle King
for a feast.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.300
Ghost King,

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.530
here's fresh human blood.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.160
It will surely benefit
the Death Beetle King.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.750
Please.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.680
Good.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.400
He's alive.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.920
It's worth a try.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.490
That's the Death Beetle King.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:33.550
If I kill it,

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.110
the Tang Sect disciples will be freed

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.440
from the Death Beetles.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:48.550
No.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.960
There are other intruders here.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.270
Xiao Qiushui?

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:07.950
Tang Song, Tang Qing,

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.610
escort the Ghost King out.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.630
Split up and be careful.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:46.920
Oh, no.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.340
It's Energy-Dissolving Powder.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.840
His internal energy...

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.350
How is this possible?

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.480
Liu Suifeng.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.590
Today…

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.840
Qiushui!

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.030
There's an ambush below!

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:24.770
Be careful!

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.190
Tang Fang.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.000
Tang Fang! Tang Fang!

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:33.870
Qiushui, be careful!

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.230
Tang Fang, are you alright?

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.440
I inhaled the Energy-Dissolving Powder.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.370
I'll get you out first.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.760
Let's go.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:05.840
Big Brother!

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.760
Big Brother!

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.190
Miss Tang, are you hurt?

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.850
We're both fine.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.310
No time to talk. Save the others.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.280
Okay.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.750
Guys, check them carefully.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:26.960
Big Brother,

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.220
he's still breathing.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:29.880
Yes.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.280
They've just been knocked out by poison.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.940
Their lives aren't in danger.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:33.630
Okay.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.710
Get them all out.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.880
Search the entire cave.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.070
Then we'll meet at Taoran Pavilion.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.630
The Ghost Cave has been exposed.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.090
But I can't lose control
of the Misery Pills.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.150
The Ghost King has left the Ghost Cave
with the Death Beetle King.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.760
Master.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.880
I don't think Xiao Qiushui

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.190
will cause us any trouble now.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.450
How has Xiao Qiushui's

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.800
internal energy
grown so much stronger
in such a short time?

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.660
Are you hiding something from me?

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.590
I...

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.960
I...

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.230
I did keep something from you.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.560
Xiao Qiushui has taken the Infinite Pill.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.610
Do you know the price of betraying me?

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.840
Master, let me explain.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.300
Even if it costs me my life,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.920
I'd never betray you.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.400
Is that so?

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.030
What kind of spell

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.630
has Xiao Qiushui cast on you?

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.800
I didn't let him fool me.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.710
It's just that he saved me

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.710
from Shao Liulei,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.530
and I wanted to repay that debt.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.000
I swear, apart from you, Master,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.070
I want no ties with anyone else.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.410
So you're saying

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.850
anyone who has done you a favor

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.080
can buy your loyalty?

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.890
I won't keep someone

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.480
as fickle as you

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.590
by my side.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:51.840
Master, I was wrong.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.760
Even the greatest favor

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.510
cannot shake my loyalty to you.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.840
I only helped him out of expedience.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.190
I was just curious

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.320
to see what someone like him

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:05.360
could do

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.760
if he survived.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.230
But if he ever threatens you,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.720
I will not spare him.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:12.550
Someone like him?

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.490
What kind of person is that?

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.190
Answer me!

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.070
I can't explain.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.360
I just feel

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.110
that he's different from anyone

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:34.560
I've ever known before.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.360
Every time I see him,

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.220
he makes me feel

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.600
that one doesn't have to live on the edge

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.000
and could choose a different life.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.590
Maybe it's just
because he always does strange things

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.920
and says strange words,

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.630
and it feels new, that's all.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.430
Whatever the reason,

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.760
hiding it from you was my fault.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.230
I accept punishment.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:12.370
Go kneel on the Repentance Cliff.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.000
No water for 7 days.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.200
If heaven sends rain,

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.550
you may live.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:23.880
Yes.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.680
At this season, it's scorching
on the Repentance Cliff.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.200
Seven days kneeling there…
she may not survive it.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.880
Master has always been ruthless.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.760
You know that.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.550
I just thought

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.860
he'd make an exception for Miss Song.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.480
No.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.120
You're wrong.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.090
Master could have killed me directly,

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.150
but he didn't.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.280
He treats me differently after all.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.070
Cheers, Big Brother!

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:47.130
Come on.

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:49.840
Cheers.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:54.960
I think

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:56.760
you should all toast to me next.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.360
If I hadn't noticed

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.840
the clues Big Brother left along the way,

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.440
it could've been dangerous.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.710
Then here's to you.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.960
Big Brother,

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.760
as soon as we heard
that the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.440
was fighting with the Power Gang nearby,

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.040
we rushed over immediately.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:16.070
We met these two brothers on the way

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.670
and went together with them.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.000
But too bad—

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.280
we found nothing in the Ghost Cave.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.760
They took everything away.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.150
Liu Suifeng has always been cautious,

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.290
so he must have moved everything out.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:29.670
But it was worth it.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.190
As soon as I arrived today,
I saw Miss Tang

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.190
standing very close to Big Brother.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360
Right.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.070
I saw that too.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:43.510
The way Big Brother and Miss Tang
worked side by side,

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.840
they really looked like a good match.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.030
Right!

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.510
Shut up. What are you talking about?

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.640
Stop this nonsense.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.150
Come on, drink.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:52.670
Drink up.

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:53.800
Come on, cheers!

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.230
Cheers, Big Brother!

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.550
Come on, cheers!

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.070
Everyone's here.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.800
Finally, we followed Zuoqiu's markers

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.000
and found this place.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.010
Perfect timing. Sit down and eat.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.480
Please sit, Miss Qu.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.610
Two more wine bowls.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.880
Zuoqiu,

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.110
aren't you going to introduce us
to your new friends?

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.710
These two are the Qu sisters.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.110
I'm Tie Xingyue.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.910
I'm Qiu Nangu.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:22.630
Good.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.100
It's a reunion of old friends.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.510
Let's have a few more drinks.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840
Alright, come on!

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.370
The Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
is invincible!

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.320
Look at this.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.110
I have to show it to you.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.800
This is…

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.440
The Hero Command Token.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.210
How did you find it?

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.360
That day, Old Madam Wu gave me a dagger.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.260
She said Mr. Zhang wanted
to give it to me.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.360
I accidentally discovered

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.160
this crystal inside the dagger.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.000
This crystal is the Hero Command Token.
