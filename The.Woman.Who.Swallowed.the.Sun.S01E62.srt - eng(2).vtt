WEBVTT

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.170
This...

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.640
(Episode 62)

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.710
It belongs to Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.750
Really?

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.620
Are you sure?

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.990
Absolutely sure it's
Chairman Min Doo Sik's?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.160
If I don't recognize it, who would?

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.290
I'm certain.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.330
So it was him after all...

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.870
And do what? Go and confront him?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.400
Let go of me.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.470
So I'm just supposed to do nothing?

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.010
How can I?
Not after what Min Doo Sik did to Pil Doo.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.710
Are you going to go in and punch him?
Or grab him by the collar?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.720
If that would help, I wouldn't stop you.
In fact, I'd even help you.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.120
But you know it's not that simple.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.690
That's not going to solve anything.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.680
This bloody handkerchief...

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.580
It can't be used to punish Min Doo Sik.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.620
You know that.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.490
You know how he'll retaliate.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.290
How could anyone...

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.290
do something this cruel?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.310
Right now, this isn't just
about punishing Min Doo Sik.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.310
We have to take away Mingang Distribution,
which he built on others' suffering.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.010
To Chairman Min Doo Sik,
Mingang is his entire life.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.990
If Mingang collapses, he'll self-destruct.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.060
And then the whole truth will be revealed
to the world.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.930
The shares in this company
that belonged to your parents...

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.400
you have to get them back.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.270
My parents...

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.440
had shares?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.580
That's right.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.480
So just be patient
for a little while longer.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.420
It's what your parents would've wanted.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.530
That Min Doo Sik... What a monster.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.900
Tae Kyung must be devastated.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.370
He's been holding on all this time,
just for that one person's testimony.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.470
Now that our only witness is gone,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.240
things just got a lot harder.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.280
What if there's no way
to prove his parents' innocence now?

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.750
We may not have a witness,
but we still have one piece of evidence.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.590
His parents' contract is in
Tae Kyung's landlord's safe.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.820
That's why you said he moved
into that house on purpose, right?

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.090
Then he should have stolen it by now.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.260
You know Tae Kyung isn't
that kind of person.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.570
You're right. Tae Kyung wouldn't do
something like that.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.100
Then I guess someone
who's capable has to do it.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.040
What are you planning on doing?

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.580
I want to see Min Doo Sik's downfall...

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.440
just as much as you do.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.110
I can't just stand idly by, can I?

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.090
My arms, legs, shoulders, knees...
Everything aches.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.190
Honey, can you give me a massage
right here?

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.530
Forget it.
I feel like I'm dying too. Seriously.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.760
Here, this should help with the fatigue.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.100
Thank you.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.700
This is absolute hell.
It's not like we're the housekeepers.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.940
She's so arrogant
because she has Father backing her up.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.810
This is exactly why you have to be careful
who you let into the family.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.880
That nobody who just waltzed in here.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.750
Well, if you're going to point fingers,
your father is the one to blame.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.880
It's absurd for him to remarry
at his age. Seriously!

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.950
What's this little get-together about?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.690
Talking about me, were you?

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.760
If you have something to say,
say it to my face.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.000
Did I do something wrong?

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.170
Well, since you brought it up,
I'll say it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.600
You just got here. Who do you think
you are, acting like you own the place?

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.710
Making us do housework
was crossing a line.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.580
And your tone of voice.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.940
I'm still older than you, you know.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.880
You have no right to talk to me
like I'm a child.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.250
Manager Gong,
do you have something to add?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.350
Oh, no, I just...

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.090
Go on. You have plenty of complaints.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.490
It'd be weird if you didn't
in this situation.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.100
I would just ask that you respect the way
things are done in this house.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.530
Alright, now it's my turn.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.940
I heard from the agency,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.710
this family is seen
as a bunch of pushovers.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.940
They say we're clueless when they are lazy
and we'll pay them whatever they ask.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.950
I was so humiliated when I heard that.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.950
How can an employer be treated
like a fool...

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.220
by the very people they're paying?

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.120
Like I said,
you have to know the work to assign it.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.460
I'm not saying
we shouldn't hire a housekeeper.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.200
Is it so much to ask that we learn
the ropes so we can manage them properly?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.200
And it's ridiculous for a parent and child
to bicker about who's older.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.600
Besides, the chairman said
I could be informal.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.540
"This family's way of doing things?"

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.880
If being pushovers is this family's style,
don't you think it's time for a change?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.020
Here's the information
on the male employees you asked for.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.750
But why do you need this all of a sudden?

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.990
These have all been vetted, right?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.230
There's no way one of them could be using
a fake identity, right?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.830
No, that's impossible.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.760
We verify their information upon hiring
and collect all relevant documentation.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.100
But is there some kind of problem?

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.880
Ever since I started drinking this,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.710
You fall asleep, and before you know it,
it's morning.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.720
They say a good night's sleep is the key
to good health.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.150
You have no idea how much healthier
you look these days.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.860
It's like you're getting younger
every day.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.760
In spirit, maybe.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.390
But because I'm out like a light
every night,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.730
I don't get to spend any time with you.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.760
Don't you worry about me.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.470
I'm happy just watching over you
while you sleep.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.140
Oh boy. Is that drink kicking in already?

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.240
Gosh, my eyelids feel like lead.
I think I'd better go lie down.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.080
Oh, dear. Oh, boy.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.280
Gosh, I'm so tired.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.650
You cruel man.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.290
How could you just crush
Tae Kyung's last hope like that?

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.420
Just you wait.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.090
Before long,
your sins will come back to choke you.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.540
Dad sure is a lucky man.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.480
To have someone who dotes on him
so devotedly.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.010
Of course.
I have to take good care of him.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.410
Isn't that right, dear?

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.950
"Dear?"

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.950
You haven't forgotten our deal, have you?

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.120
You're supposed to get Father's shares
and give them to me, no matter what.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.690
I only just got married.
Stop being so impatient.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.660
The more you want something,
the more you need to learn to be patient.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.600
I know.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.440
That's why I'm being so patient, see?

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.070
Stepmother.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.530
You and Soo Jung still seem quite close.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.330
You two were so tight before the wedding.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.630
Is there something wrong
with getting along?

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.140
I just worry that such a good relationship
won't last.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.970
- Worried about what?
- Just a general concern.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.910
You never know what might happen.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.940
That's just how relationships are.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.390
Has she been doing anything suspicious
around the house?

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.420
No.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.330
But, Ms. Kyung Chae...

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.060
Now that they're married,

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.130
what if the chairman gives her some stock?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.400
That's not going to happen,
so don't worry.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.670
She's the type to give up any shares...

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.140
just to marry my father.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.010
Really? So she's all bark and no bite.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.780
So if we all stick together
and refuse to accept her as the lady here,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.880
she'll be just his woman in this house,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.420
and leave with nothing when she gives up.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.190
That's exactly right.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.090
Whew. I feel like a huge weight
has been lifted off my chest.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.490
Good grief. The nerve of her.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.600
(Mingang Distribution)

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.580
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.810
Yes, Secretary Kim.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.750
Go to my home and get an outfit
from Manager Gong.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.350
Tell her it's for the leaders' meeting.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.090
What do you think you're doing?

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.760
Didn't you hear me?

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.970
What does it look like I'm doing?

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.240
Why did you enter our room without asking
and go through the chairman's clothes?

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.370
I'm following the chairman's orders.
He told me to get his meeting outfit.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.040
Step aside. I'll do it.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.350
Sir, I got the call from your driver
and was preparing your outfit,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.320
but your wife insists on doing it herself.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.960
I'm not sure she understands the event,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.760
or knows what attire is right,

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.230
but since she insists,
should I let her do it?

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.470
I'll just step aside, then.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.840
Yes, sir. One moment.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.840
It's for you.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.980
Yes, dear.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.580
Let Manager Gong handle it.
That's her specialty.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.080
Okay.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.560
She just lives off his empty flattery,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.760
liable to be kicked out broke at any time.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.730
The nerve of her, trying to steal my job.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.340
Manager Gong?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.540
I need to use the restroom.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.580
The first-floor bathroom isn't clean.
Use the one on the second floor.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.610
Follow me.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.570
What in the world?
What's gotten into Manager Gong?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.140
What?
Is this some kind of joke or something?

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.270
(Mingang Distribution)

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.570
Unbelievable.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.750
I was in such a rush getting here.
I'm not too late, am I?

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.420
What are you doing here?
You didn't even call.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.520
When your driver left, I went to the room,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.760
and your outfit was still there.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.290
I think Manager Gong
must've gotten confused.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.430
You know how it is with women her age.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.870
That's not something to be confused about.
What does she even do all day?

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.770
I keep telling her she's doing a good job,
and now she's gotten complacent.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.340
Gosh, what would I have done without you?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.450
I don't care how busy you were.
What were you thinking, sending this?

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.260
I sent that?

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.560
If not you, who else?

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.330
Did you want me to show up in my pajamas?

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.860
Why would I do that?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.500
That's not true, sir.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.670
Would I ever do something like that?

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.670
It can happen. Anyone can make a mistake.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.810
Excuse me?

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.740
I'm telling you, it wasn't me!

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.550
Don't be too hard on her.
It was an honest mistake.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.480
I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.880
Please, calm down and head inside.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.120
Honestly.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.020
But it wasn't me.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.230
I didn't do it. You believe me, don't you?

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.170
- I'm not that kind of person.
- I know.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.670
There's no way you'd make
that kind of mistake.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.240
That woman...
She must have switched them on purpose.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.580
What am I going to do?

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.310
The chairman is going to think
I'm losing it.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.920
Surely he wouldn't think that.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.350
Father will probably just chalk it up
to a simple mistake.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.820
Surprised to hear from me out of the blue?

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.330
Not at all.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.600
Lucia and I used to live together,
but now I'm all alone.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.730
You must be heartbroken
that Lucia married Chairman Min Doo Sik.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.940
But not as much as she is.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.210
She had no other choice.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:01.850
What's important is,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.850
that depending on our next move,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.820
we can speed up Lucia's return to you.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.660
What is this?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.000
Chairman Min Doo Sik's secret files.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.270
The witness who was about to testify
was murdered over this,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.510
so Lucia decided to hand it over.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.810
She struggled to get it from Kim Sun Jae,

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.640
but she did it willingly, for you.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.210
Do you see how she feels about you now?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.100
Now, you need to trace the illegal funds
inside Mingang Distribution...

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.410
and find a way to put Min Doo Sik away
for white-collar crime.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.740
A penny for your thoughts?

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.550
Kim Sun Jae and Min Kyung Chae.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.720
First, drive a wedge between them.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.580
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.450
Oh, it's nothing.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.190
Ma'am, if you have a moment...

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.430
would you like to have a cup of tea?

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.560
This is unexpected from you.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.860
All right.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.330
Come to my office.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.650
I must say, this is a surprise.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.320
You asking me for tea.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.290
To be honest,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.660
it's just that Lawyer Kim
is always attached to your hip.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.390
I've wanted to have a moment like this
for a while now.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.030
And also because I have some concerns.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.600
What kind of concerns?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.040
It's about Lawyer Kim Sun Jae.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.570
Of course, he's very capable,

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.410
and he has your trust and the chairman's.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.440
So I'm a little hesitant to bring this up.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.280
When I was in the States,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.990
there was an incident where someone
on the legal team...

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.720
embezzled the owner's slush fund
that he was managing.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.760
To the owner, it was dirty money,
so he couldn't even report it.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.360
Losing everything and keeping it quiet,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.230
it was enough to drive the owner crazy.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.340
So, you're suggesting Lawyer Kim
is deceiving the chairman and me...

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.700
and lining his own pockets?

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.270
Of course not. That can't be happening.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.680
But there's no harm in making sure.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.950
Especially if it means
you can trust him more fully.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.260
Why are you suddenly so close
with Ms. Min?

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.030
We've had our ups and downs
over the years.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.100
We have quite a history.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.240
- "We?"
- You of all people should know.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.840
She's the one who brought me
into this company,

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.750
and she has been waiting for me.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.780
Are you saying...

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.020
that the two of you have some kind
of special relationship?

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.750
Well, I don't know
if I'd call it "special,"

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.520
but our closeness didn't happen overnight.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.690
That's not how it looks to me.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.960
It looks more like you have
an ulterior motive.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.330
If one of us has an ulterior motive,

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.570
wouldn't it be you, Mr. Kim?

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.070
If you say not, then fine.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.070
But when someone changes overnight,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.010
it's rarely a good sign.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.780
Nothing about me has changed.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.980
If it looks that way to you...

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.480
it must be because
the situation has changed.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.960
Lawyer Kim is certainly capable,

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.070
and I hesitate to bring this up,

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.270
but there's no harm in making sure.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.340
Especially if it allows you
to trust him more.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.040
A man like Director Moon...

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.250
wouldn't say something like that
for no reason.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.990
Hey, the weather's so nice.
Should we go do something fun?

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.860
Just the two of us?

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.660
Yep, just the two of us.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:41.790
Okay.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.330
Where to?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.960
Hold on.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.300
No. They're talking
in Ms. Se Ri's room now.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.640
Keep a close watch on her.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.940
Especially what she might try
to pull with Se Ri.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.040
Don't worry. I'm listening to everything.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.150
If she misbehaves, I'll record it
and send the evidence to Chairman Min.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.450
Yes, ma'am.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.890
Who were you reporting to?

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.420
Was it Ms. Min?

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.160
I thought I told you to stop that.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.530
As lady of this house, I'm warning you,
do this again and I won't let it slide.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:26.870
Why aren't you answering me?

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.840
It's me.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.110
I got the ledger from Ms. Jang.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.340
That should be admissible as evidence...

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.680
if this goes to trial.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.880
Would that really be enough?

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.720
You've seen what Min Doo Sik can do.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.320
Living in the same house as that man...

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.750
Don't worry about me.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.120
- I knew what I was getting into.
- I'm worried about you.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.560
The man has blood on his hands.
Who knows what he's capable of?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.070
Besides, you don't have anyone
on your side in that house.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.500
Stop worrying about me
and just focus on your work, Tae Kyung.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.070
And ask Ms. Jang for help if you need it.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.670
Baek Sul Hee.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.880
You know...

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.110
you're the only person
who knows who I really am.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.450
About my parents' story...

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.650
and my pain.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:53.020
You're the only one.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.790
You're the only one for me too, Tae Kyung.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.700
The one I'll love until the very end.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.470
I have to go. Talk to you later.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.070
- Who was that at this hour?
- Oh, just a friend.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.940
Doo Sik, it's time for your medicine.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.380
Oh, right.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.160
Don't be so rude to Manager Gong.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.300
What did you just say?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.210
I said she's not someone
you can disrespect.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.870
Say that again.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.410
"You?"

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.480
Manager Gong is like family to us.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.450
I said, say it again.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.480
Did you really just address me like that?

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.820
Then what should I call you?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:01.360
- Should I call you Stepmother?
- Go on! Let's hear you say it.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.930
What's wrong?
Can't bring yourself to say it?

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.530
Are you crazy?

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.900
So you'd have to be crazy
to call me "Stepmother," is that it?

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.970
Eavesdropping like a little rat,
getting secret reports...

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.970
The one giving the orders
and the one following them...

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.510
Why are you so curious about
what I do in this house?

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.050
What do you hope to accomplish
by having Manager Gong spy on me?

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.950
So you can't pull another stunt
like switching the chairman's outfit.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.220
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.630
You're only getting away with this...

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.730
because the chairman thinks
you're an angel.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.000
You're one to talk,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.500
making accusations
without a shred of proof.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.510
You're lucky the chairman is asleep,
or this would be a lot worse.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.280
- Or else I would've slapped you.
- You'd hit me?

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.510
You hit me, remember?

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.180
Don't you remember?

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.820
So what?
You're going to get your revenge now?

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.190
Not revenge. A lesson.
A lesson in manners.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.190
You need to be taught
not to raise your hand to people.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.490
On second thought,
the problem in this house isn't Se Ri.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.530
It's you, the eldest daughter.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.770
Well, you're certainly playing
the stepmother role to a T.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.400
Sinking your claws into an old chairman,

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.770
it looks like you're enjoying
bossing around his grown children.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.010
But I'm warning you.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.180
If you ever disrespect Manager Gong again,

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.610
I won't let it slide.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:45.530
Talk about being on pins and needles.
It was unbearable.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.530
Seriously,
how can those two be exactly alike?

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.530
Well, Kyung Chae's always been like that,

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.800
but I never thought she would be too.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.740
That's because someone is backing her.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.440
When people get some power behind them,

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.210
they start to think they own the world.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.610
So, do you call her "Stepmother?"

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.750
Ja Kyung, do you call her "Mother?"

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.750
What kind of slow-witted nonsense is that?

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.650
Stop talking such rot.
"Mother?" Don't make me laugh.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.260
You could put a knife to my throat,
and I'd never call her "Mother."

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.560
Don't you dare.
It's bad enough she's freeloading here.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.630
"Mother?" As if.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:22.430
Goodness, what will you two do
if you get on the chairman's bad side?

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.940
Dad, just give him his job back already.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.410
He needs to have some pull at work
so he can get some respect at home.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.510
She's right, honey.
If you'll do it anyway, get it over with.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.810
Yeah, come on, Dad!

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:36.450
- Father-in-law...
- Honey...

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.810
- Father-in-law...
- Dad!

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.920
All right, all right! Enough already!
What, did you all rehearse this?

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.150
Don't you worry.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.760
I'll settle this once and for all
before the day is out.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.600
Well, my fellow in-law, newlywed life
at your age must be sweet as honey.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.970
You're glowing like a flower blooming
on a manure pile.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.440
So what is this urgent business
you called me about?

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.480
Well now, someone's in a hurry.
Let's take our time.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.780
Here, take this first.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.650
It's bush clover. They say it can make
a sleeping elephant stand at attention.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.950
I thought you might have some use
for it these days.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:20.420
I have a meeting scheduled,
so if you'll excuse me.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.660
But this is more vital than any meeting.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.860
I'd be disappointed if you left now.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.500
Now see here, my fellow in-law.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:34.200
Isn't it about time
you gave our Ji Seop his job back?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.080
And if you make me an outside director
at Mingang Distribution,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.640
that would be just ducky.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.350
No matter how busy you are,
you're going to want to see this.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.760
CEO Han Kyung Soo of Doeun Industries.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.400
A while back, the man told me
he needed funds for his business,

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.170
so he came looking for me.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.270
The collateral he put up at the time...

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.040
is this.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.240
Not long after he put this up
and borrowed my hard-earned money,

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.080
CEO Han and his wife died
in a mysterious accident,

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.780
on the very same day,
at the very same time. So I heard.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.550
But strangely enough, at some point,

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.920
this new technology ended up with Mingang.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.430
Doesn't that strike you as a bit fishy?

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.090
The original owner is dead,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.170
and the totally unrelated Chairman Min
gets his hands on the new technology,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.900
and then Doeun Industries
gets taken over by Mingang.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.810
Are you using this to blackmail me?

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.010
Blackmail?

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.740
Why would I do such a thing?

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.810
We're practically family.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.920
Our children are married to each other.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.500
Go ahead, tear it up.
Rip it! Rip it to shreds!

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.930
Rip it to shreds!
That'll solve everything, won't it?

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.870
If that were the original, yes.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.340
But what a shame, it's just a copy.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.440
Chairman Min.

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.240
Think about it carefully.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.150
It's not that big of an ask, is it? Right?

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.220
Well?

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.060
Give me a call soon.
But be warned, I'm an impatient man.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.030
Darn it all, I can't wait for long.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.870
I'll be on my way.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:47.340
I've fallen for Mingang.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.240
Darn it!

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.460
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.740
Then go to your father-in-law tomorrow.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.010
Tell him the Mingang director job is his.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.580
But on one condition.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.550
To Kim Sun Jae, I'm just
a stepping stone to move up in the world,

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.320
nothing more and nothing less.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.920
If you bring up that secret ledger again
to rattle Ms. Min,

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.290
I won't let you get away with it.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.560
I'm saying getting rid of you
would be nothing to me.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.630
What do you think you're doing?

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.300
