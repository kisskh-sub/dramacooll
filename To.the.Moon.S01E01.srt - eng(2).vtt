00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.090
Welcome, passengers.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.190
Thank you for riding
with us again today.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.960
Our train is departing
from the wretched reality...

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.100
where the value of labor
is not respected,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.900
bound for its final destination,
the Moon.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.840
However, we cannot guarantee...

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.350
your safe arrival.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.620
Along the way,
you will face numerous hardships, trials,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.290
and some rather cringey situations.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.860
Nevertheless, for those of you
with unrealized dreams and hopes,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.330
we urge you
to please board promptly.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.500
The train is now departing.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.960
I can do this.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.930
I can get...

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.600
a permanent position.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.570
(Honey)

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.170
Honey, did you get there okay?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.040
Don't be nervous. You got this!
You'll definitely get the position.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140
I love you!

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.050
(New hire and temp-to-perm
interviews for Marron Confectionery)

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.280
Ms. Jung Da Hae?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.380
- Come in.
- Okay.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.720
I see you've interned
with us before.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.520
Yes. It wasn't a standard program,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.530
but they gave me
a great opportunity,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.160
and I spent the last year interning here
at Marron Confectionery.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.430
If we hire you,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.600
are there any products
you'd like to develop?

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.770
Marron Confectionery is
very popular with consumers,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.640
but its market share in
the pie category is relatively low.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.510
That's why I'd like to launch
an original pie product.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.210
All right, then. What is this?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.780
Why don't you explain the key points
for the Kong Kong Chip?

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.690
I believe the key marketing point
is childhood nostalgia.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.290
The first color TV ad concept
won over people...

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.460
in their 30s and 40s,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.730
and I believe
it resonated strongly with them.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.330
Do you have any final remarks?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.500
Yes.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.210
I am truly eager to
officially join your company.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.210
If you give me the opportunity
to work here permanently...

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.580
Was she stung by a bee?
Was she stung?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.580
Are you okay? Ms. Jung?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.120
- What should we do?
- Ms. Jung?

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.900
Are you with me?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.330
What?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.970
Why is my face over there?

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.570
Just calm down.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.810
Wait a minute. Is this a dream?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.870
Or am I dead?

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.610
- Are you the Grim Reaper?
- No, it's not like that.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.180
You just passed out for a second.
I'm your future self, Jung Da Hae.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.680
What?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.150
Me from the future?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.990
There's no need to stare.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.520
Sadly, the diet was a bust.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.090
You must've eaten
something really good.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.630
But what's with your appearance?

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.170
What happened?
Is there a war in the future?

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.530
Are you a refugee?

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.900
I'm not sure.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.170
Even if so, you've got nowhere
to seek refuge, right?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.810
- What?
- Whatever.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.170
I'll get straight to the point.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.610
You cannot join this company.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.380
- That's why I came here.
- What are you talking about?

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.780
Hey! Do you know how hard
I worked to be an employee here?

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.220
If I just ace this interview today,
I'll become a permanent employee.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.360
You don't know what you're saying.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.720
Not all permanent jobs are equal.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.390
You're...

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.990
You're...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.130
You're just a loner.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.070
You'll always live like a loner.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.300
Nothing will ever go your way,
and you'll be poor year-round.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.270
Your fate is to end up like this.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.910
You'll be consistently miserable.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.840
And you still want to work here?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.150
Gosh.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.120
Yes! I have to get this job.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.750
If I don't get a desk job at my age,
should I go be an idol star?

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.520
You think talk like that
will stop me?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.890
You're right.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.890
Talk isn't going to cut it.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.990
Then I'll just have to...

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.190
Just die!

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.160
What's gotten into you?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.070
No good will come of living anyway.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.370
End it now for a better next life.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.470
Just die!

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.040
No!
I have to get a job, even if I die.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.040
No one shows up to
a broke person's funeral.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.080
I don't want to die!

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.450
Ms. Jung Da Hae, are you okay?

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.450
Ms. Jung, you fainted.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.990
I... I just had this dream...

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.360
Goodness,
we need to get you to a hospital.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.960
Your eye is all swollen up
from that bee sting.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.600
No, I'm fine.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.370
I'd like to continue the interview.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.600
No, you really shouldn't.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.240
I'm telling you, I'm really fine.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.180
A bee sting won't crush my dream
of getting a permanent position.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.910
Please, believe in me.
I'm confident I can do a great job.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.680
They say desperation works miracles,
don't they?

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.550
Unemployment rates are hitting
a new all-time high every year.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.950
I miraculously landed
this interview.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.990
Just give me the chance.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.960
I'll be a dedicated Marron employee.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.260
And then...

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.300
Miracle, my foot.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.270
That looks so good.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.040
Gosh, look at all the pastries.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.800
Looks delicious.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.610
Why is the line so long?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.710
That looks amazing.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.750
Why aren't you answering?
Is something wrong?

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.760
I'm worried. Please text me back.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.300
Mr. Ko.
Our meeting is about to start.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.700
It's fine. It's just up ahead.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.670
But we only have ten minutes left.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.600
They say this place is even better
than the Gangnam branch.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.270
We're in the sweets business,
so think of this as market research.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.380
My mouth's watering.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.380
Come on.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.280
We're only selling ten more today!

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.620
Sorry, everyone!

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.520
What? That should be mine.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.490
- Go to the front!
- What?

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.560
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Gosh, hold on!

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.490
Stop pushing!

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.530
Wait a minute!

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.090
Wait! Gosh, my phone!

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.160
My phone! Wait, excuse me!

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.370
My phone.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.900
Wait. No. Hey, don't step on it!

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.810
Don't step on it! No. Don't...

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.480
Darn it.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.720
That jerk. He's got some luck.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.120
This is great. So decadent.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.960
We're late. Run!

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.890
Darn it.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.960
Mr. Ko!

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.080
Come on, hurry up!

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.820
Yes, I'm coming!
Why did you have to order coffee?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.080
Coffee is important to me.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.190
If I bomb my presentation
without it,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.290
will you take responsibility?

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.720
Why would it be my fault?

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.920
- Darn it.
- "Darn it?"

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.330
Are you okay?

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.770
Yes. I'm fine.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.940
I meant, is the laptop okay?
All of our data is on here.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.070
Seriously... Please be okay.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.210
This better not be broken.
It's fine.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.440
Let's go. Hurry up.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.390
Bear with it.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.860
Wait, hold the elevator!

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.420
Thank you for waiting.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.460
- I'm so sorry.
- Hurry up!

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.690
Sorry about that.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.530
Well...

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.330
We've to get off.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.270
Round, you got off?

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.570
Good. Take the stairs.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.810
What? All the way to the 14th floor?
But we only have 5 minutes left!

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.880
I'll go on ahead and get set up.
Now hurry.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.780
Mr. Ko!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.020
Darn it.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.720
I have to suck it up.
I've no choice.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.790
My performance review is coming up.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.260
I can't exactly kill Mr. Ko.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.630
Hold on.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.630
Darn it.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.640
I'm going to kill him!

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.610
It's 10:59 a.m. and 55 seconds.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.050
Fifty-six seconds.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.180
Fifty-seven seconds.
Fifty-eight seconds.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.920
Fifty-nine seconds.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.990
(Conference Room)

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.960
(Marron Confectionery)

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.630
As you can see, our new product,

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.330
My Grape Glucose, has been
in the planning stage for a while,

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.970
but the launch has been delayed
due to the high cost of ingredients.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.640
Meanwhile, our competitor,
Company B,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.780
had a bestseller with grapes
early on,

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.680
and they've already moved on
to mango and cherry flavors.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.120
So, after meeting with
both the RnD and Marketing teams,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.490
we decided to develop a new product
using Shine Muscat grapes.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.790
- Hold on.
- Yes?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.790
Shine Muscat?

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.600
Isn't that a Japanese variety?

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.800
It's from Japan?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.730
What? It's from Japan?

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.170
You didn't know?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.370
What do you mean you didn't know?

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.870
So what's your plan
for dealing with sentiment...

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.070
on the ingredient's source?

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.240
A plan?

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.740
- Our plan is...
- Do you have one?

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.880
A plan?

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.550
It'd certainly be nice to have one.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.980
What? "It'd be nice to have one?"

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.550
- Well...
- Right, so,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.290
do you have
this "nice-to-have" plan, or not?

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.290
Well, our plan is...

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.560
What am I going to do?

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.030
I've got nothing... What do I do?

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.170
Listen up!

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.340
Order up!
One big bowl of national pride!

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.390
That's the "patriotic marketing"
you've stressed, right, Mr. Cheon?

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.990
Yes, that's absolutely right.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.660
You wanted to make a point
of using domestic produce,

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.800
so you even analyzed the status of
Shine Muscat grapes grown in Korea.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.130
That's right.
That's absolutely right!

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.070
In fact, here in Korea,
ever since 2006,

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.840
- we've grown our own Shine Muscats.
- Local is best!

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.510
You can't beat homegrown!

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.150
Korea!

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.520
- Korea!
- Korea!

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.620
- Korea!
- Korea!

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.260
Ko...

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.130
Well, that's not a bad idea.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.940
When the samples are ready,
bring them to us.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.670
Good work.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.070
Thank you, Mr. Vice President!
We'll do our very best!

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.070
Thank you!

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.180
Thank you, General Affairs Manager!
Thank you, Managing Director!

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.850
Thank you, everyone!
We'll work hard.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.580
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.720
Are you okay, sir?

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.160
Sorry, everyone.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.360
If I ever drink that much again,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.930
I'm an animal. A total animal.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.060
Seriously, without Eun Sang,
that would've been a total disaster.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.030
You saved my skin again, Eun Sang.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.430
Thank you.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.870
- Hey, let's get some hangover food.
- Again?

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.940
Just how much did you drink
last night, sir?

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.020
How was the off-site meeting?

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.250
Perfect.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.160
That's our team leader for you.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.990
See? What did I tell you?
We had plenty of time.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.570
You're right.
You're the best, Mr. Ko.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.400
You're the man.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.810
Thanks, Da Hee.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.580
So you have some decency after all.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.710
At least you know to say thank you.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.780
It was nothing. Really, I'm fine.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.120
Check this out, Da Hee.
Look how good this looks.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.890
- This is killer.
- I bought it in Japan this weekend.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.490
It's a top-quality product
by an artisan, sold only in Japan.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.860
I thought it'd be nice
for everyone to try some.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.460
You're why I love coming to work, Da Hee.
You know that?

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.870
The meeting went well thanks to you.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.070
Thank you!

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.600
- You don't have to say that.
- That jerk.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.640
Here, Round. You have one too.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.240
That darn name, Round.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.980
- Da Hee.
- Yes?

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.680
No. I meant Hee, not Hae.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.750
- Da Hee.
- Right.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.490
See me for a second.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.390
(Employee Jung Da Hae)

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.730
- Ms. Da Hae?
- Yes?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.930
No, Da Hee. "Hae" as in "sun."

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.040
- Da Hae.
- Yes.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.810
I keep mixing up your names.
This is going to be a real problem.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.110
Da Hae, from now on,
I'll just call you Round.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.010
What? Why "Round?"

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.280
Do I look round to you or something?

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.850
It's not about how you look.
It's just the vibe you give off.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.490
A vibe? What does that even...

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.160
Besides, I'm just more used to
saying Da Hae's name.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.390
She started six months before you,
and it's a work thing.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.530
- Da Hee?
- Yes.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.760
Round?

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.600
Round?

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.700
- Yes, I'm here.
- See? That's better.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.240
And the name problem is solved.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.910
Round.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.350
No, I'm fine.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.310
Give me a piece.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.280
Come on, just have one.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.050
You worked so hard today.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:26.590
Well...

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.560
Okay, then.
I guess I'll have just one.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.470
Don't eat it!

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.570
Wait a second! Just hold it for me.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.640
Let's give these to the execs.
It'll make our lives easier, right?

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.440
So I'm just going to run up
to the 18th floor...

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.440
What's wrong?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.380
I chugged coffee without eating.
My stomach is really acting up.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.680
Just tell them it's from our team...

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.320
Move, get out of my way.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.590
- I'll be right back.
- Mr. Ko, are you okay?

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.890
- I'll take this up for you then?
- Yes.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.890
Da Hee.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.690
The Accounting Team wants to see
the Q1 performance report.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.030
Right.
I was going to do that in a bit...

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.100
They need it now for their meeting.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.700
Can't you just get someone...

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.170
Right.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.240
Da Hae.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.750
Come on.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.620
This is so irritating.
They dump everything on me.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.630
The 18th floor.
The room at the end of the hall?

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.760
Which one is the last room?

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.340
Excuse me.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.240
What?

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.010
Is anybody here?

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.480
Goodness.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:02.850
What is this place?

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.190
Gosh, it's like a palace in here.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.790
Goodness.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.590
What?

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.830
No way!
I've seen this in commercials.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.570
Goodness.
This is more than three months' pay.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.010
So, what's something this fancy
doing in here?

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.940
Maybe they're building
a new staff lounge?

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.880
What? Maybe just for a second.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.030
This is nice.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.360
My goodness.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.230
Gosh.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.770
Gosh, that hits the spot.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.340
Goodness.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.040
I see why this is so expensive.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.040
My gosh.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.210
It's really getting in there...

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.420
What's going on?

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.090
What?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.390
Why did it stop?

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.490
What on earth?

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.390
What?

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.590
Yes, the remodeling in my office
turned out great.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.030
You really didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.000
What was that?

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.500
But the nameplate was a bit much,
so I just had that replaced.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.040
Wasn't this the staff lounge?

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.610
Right.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.180
Gosh, what do I do?
What am I going to do?

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.050
First, I'll just get up naturally.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.390
Darn it, it won't move an inch.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:50.930
This piece of...

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.360
What's this?

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.700
What is this?

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.570
Where is it going? Is it this one?

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.070
Oh, no.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.240
(Loading. Please wait.)

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.370
Ta-da! Surprise!

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.900
Surprised, right?
You're totally shocked, aren't you?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.740
Right. You can go now.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.640
I must be out of my mind.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.250
(Doctor Ham Ji Woo)

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.890
Where have I seen her before?

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:58.130
You idiot.
Why did you have to sit there?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.060
Why won't this come off? Darn it.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.850
Excuse me.
What's wrong? Are you okay?

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.480
The evaluation forms are out.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.490
And just like that,
it was evaluation season.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.630
The company used a five-tier scale
to grade last year's performance.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.900
Congrats. Looks like you'll be
the first of us to get promoted.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.470
No way.

My treat.

"You did an awesome job."

In that case, I'll get coffee.

"Good start, but you aren't
stopping now, are you?"

they were almost done.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.890
Darn it.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.060
(Remaining balance:
Minus 764.470 dollars)

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.930
(Remaining balance:
Minus 1,410.32 dollars)

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.130
It's been a while.
Tell that jerk to come to our reunion.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.870
Not pretty.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.740
My bank balance
is not pretty at all.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.910
I have to meet Wei Lin.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.550
We were supposed to go snowboarding
in Pyeongchang.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.290
You're still with Beijing Baby?
You haven't broken up?

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.550
Break up?

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.360
Our love is forever and ever, okay?

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.990
What do you know about love?

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.130
I don't know much about
unprofitable things like love,

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:08.960
but I do know about something else.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.300
And what's that?

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.270
- It's called crypto.
- I know.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.310
- You do?
- You mean like a karaoke booth?

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:21.980
- No, not a karaoke booth.
- Not a booth? Like a laundromat?

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.310
Not a coin laundromat.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.420
That cryptocurrency stuff?

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.550
Cryptocurrency...

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.350
You mean like in-game money?

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.390
Seriously?
How can you compare it to game cash?

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.260
- Da Hae, what's wrong?
- Hey, I'm in the middle of talking.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.500
Da Hae, what's up with you?

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.300
What?

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.270
It's nothing.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.100
It's obviously not nothing.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.870
So what's wrong?
What's on your mind?

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.110
No, it's not that.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:53.880
Actually...

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:56.410
The truth is...

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.180
Byeong Jun...

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.920
Asked you to marry him?

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.090
- What?
- It's about that time, right?

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.550
Don't tell me he proposed.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.260
- Oh, my gosh.
- No. Don't jump to conclusions.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.530
Marriage? Are you kidding?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.360
- It's not?
- I said, no.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.570
And besides, I'm the type
who'd rather live together first.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.240
So you're moving in together?

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.540
- Seriously. I said no.
- What is this?

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.580
- Why does she keep cutting me off?
- What?

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.680
- I have to go!
- What's going on?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.450
- Hey, wait!
- What's gotten into her?

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.320
Come on!

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.050
- What is all this?
- Mr. Song.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.760
- Is all of this yours, Ms. Kim?
- I meant to use my home address,

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.330
- but used the office address.
- What?

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.670
I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.770
How could you be so...

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.640
Mr. Song! Are you okay?

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.610
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.610
Are you okay? Are you all right?

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.240
Ms. Kim Ji Song, seriously.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.710
Oh, what am I going to do with you?

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.980
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.380
- What do I do?
- I'm leaving.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.650
- Bye.
- Let me help you up.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.020
A pain patch, Mr. Yoon.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.390
- Does anyone have a patch?
- Gosh, my back.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.590
Christmas is just around the corner,

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.690
and as we await the birth
of baby Jesus,

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.660
how about we all go grab a drink?
Let's go!

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.400
My parents are waiting for me.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.800
My girlfriend's waiting for me.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.930
My delivery driver is waiting.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.540
I guess I'm the only one
waiting for baby Jesus.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.440
If you don't want to go,
just say so.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.880
Goodness.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.840
Fine, then I'll go by myself.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.250
See you all next week.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.420
- Good work, everyone.
- Good work, everyone.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:47.990
(My birthday)

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.930
Have a good weekend, Da Hae.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.960
Oh, you too.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.580
I'm out.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.750
- I'm off?
- Okay. See you.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.250
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.700
Is she gone?

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.700
- She's gone.
- She's gone. Let's go.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.350
This is going to be fun.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.680
The phone is turned off.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.380
Please leave a message
after the tone.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.150
You'll be charged after the tone.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.090
(Honey)

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.870
Excuse me.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.540
What?

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.610
It's my boyfriend.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.480
He's gone missing.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.280
Please, you have to find him.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.690
It's fine. It's just one dish.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:04.590
- You sure?
- Yes.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.890
Hey, stop it.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.900
What's with you? There you go again.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.770
Hey! I'm trying to cook here!

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.300
I knew you'd do this.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:13.930
No dinner for you.

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:15.700
Okay.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.170
- Go open the wine, then.
- The wine?

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:19.740
- Yes.
- This one?

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.180
I'm almost done with this.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.210
Where's the corkscrew?

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.420
Right. I forgot
I was supposed to buy one.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.620
You can't open it
without one, can you?

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:35.120
I don't think so.
Hold on. I'll go get one real quick.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.590
- Okay. See you soon.
- I'll be right back.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:39.290
- Yes. Hurry back.
- Okay.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.400
At first,

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.830
I thought
it was part of some surprise.

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.470
Tomorrow's my birthday.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.170
I thought
if I just waited a little while,

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:30.410
he'd walk in with flowers and a cake
and go, "Ta-da! Surprise!"

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.550
But...

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.420
He didn't come back?

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.120
He didn't.
After an hour, he still wasn't back.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.690
Then two hours,
and he still wasn't back.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:44.590
That's when I got a bad feeling
that something was really wrong.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.730
Excuse me, did you see a tall guy
come in to buy a corkscrew?

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.730
From then on,
I just kept looking for Byeong Jun.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:53.600
The phone is turned off.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.070
I went to the playground
where he'd go for smoke breaks,

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.410
and I even went to his place
to check, but...

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.170
Byeong Jun!

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:02.910
Lee Byeong Jun!

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:07.010
- Lee Byeong Jun!
- Gosh, it's so darn loud.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.280
- Some of us are trying to sleep!
- Sorry.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.990
But he wasn't there. Nowhere.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.160
And then, my mind started going
to some pretty wild places.

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:22.460
Wild places? Like what?

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.870
It's not like he just shot up
into the sky,

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.800
so I thought maybe
he'd been swallowed by the earth.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.900
Yes, like into a sinkhole.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.880
You know in like disaster movies,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.310
bridges collapse,
and people get trapped in buildings.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.880
Disasters like that happen, right?

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.490
A sinkhole seems plausible,
don't you think?

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.420
(Screaming)

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.590
But I kept waiting,
and there was no word from MOLIT.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.260
So you actually waited.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.260
Then I even thought about calling
the Ministry of National Defense.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.800
The Ministry of National Defense?
Why?

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.840
I figured it must be
their handiwork.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.210
Aliens.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.210
A UFO came down
and abducted Byeong Jun.

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:10.310
Help!

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.480
It's not completely impossible,
right?

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.120
I'm not so sure.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.090
How about we stick to something
more plausible, shall we?

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.350
When he vanished,
did your boyfriend...

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.260
seem different than usual?

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.420
Was he going through a hard time?

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.290
Was there a situation
that might've upset him?

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.500
It was a pretty ordinary day.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.400
That day...

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.230
That day...

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.440
If I have to pinpoint something,

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.410
when we were on our date
earlier that day,

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.510
I kept asking him
to turn on his hotspot.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.180
I'm on a budget phone service,
and I'd used up all my data.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.010
- Data. Got it.
- I was complaining about my boss...

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.580
I just kept trash-talking my boss.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.220
So, I guess that might have
annoyed him a bit.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.890
Also, after we ate,
I paid for our coffee, but...

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.830
I paid for it
with a handful of coins.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.430
I didn't have enough
on my debit card.

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.300
What else?

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.470
There's more? All right.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440
Well...

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.040
It's just that...

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.530
- What?
- What?

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.070
(Real Estate Monthly Rent Contract)

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.770
Oh, this?

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.470
It's almost time to renew my lease.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.310
I should probably move.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.540
And I should probably start thinking
about marriage too.

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.280
This lousy apartment.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:59.920
And they have the nerve
to raise the rent.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.260
The bathroom doesn't even have
a threshold.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.190
Today, again,

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.660
I had to shower so fast,
worried the water would spill out.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.400
Why not use some waterproof tape?
Want me to do it?

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.040
No, it's fine.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.570
It'll just peel right off anyway.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.750
I'll just...

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.780
Gosh, I'm hungry.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.150
Aren't you?

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.490
Should we grab a bite first?

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.420
Sure.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.930
How about some wine?

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:42.330
Let's grill some eel to go with it.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.400
It's cold, so we need a hearty meal.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:46.000
Sounds good.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.680
What's rent like
in your neighborhood?

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:03.280
It's whatever.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.350
It seems like an easy commute
to work,

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.760
and with all the hospitals nearby,
it seems like a nice place to live.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.130
You think so?

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.030
So,

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.070
I was wondering...

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.000
if I moved in with you...

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.370
I'm not proposing or anything.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.640
It's just that if we lived together,

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.110
we could save on some expenses.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.680
It doesn't have to be fancy
or anything.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.720
We can keep it simple and low-key.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.120
I mean, we can always get married
down the road.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.420
What? There's no corkscrew.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:51.060
Right. I forgot
I was supposed to buy one.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:55.300
You can't open it without one,
can you?

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.470
I don't think so.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.340
Hold on. I'll go get one real quick.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.780
Oh, okay.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.380
Hurry back.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.930
He left,
and I never heard from him again.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.030
As I was objectively laying out
my situation,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.100
it dawned on me.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.570
Byeong Jun was gone.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.840
Because he didn't want to marry me.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.480
That jerk.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.580
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
That just slipped out.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.350
No, it's okay.
That's actually comforting.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.850
Oh, I shouldn't have...

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.590
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's just that...

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.830
You shouldn't waste valuable time
chasing after some deadbeat.

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.400
I'd like to withdraw my report.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.170
Gosh. Wait. Miss.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.610
Stay strong!

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.450
- Stay strong!
- Stay strong!

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.720
I will.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.500
FYI, she likes whipped cream.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.040
Sorry, my bad. Wrong chat.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.370
I'm so sorry.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.750
Thank you.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.720
Hey. What if Da Hae finds out?

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.550
How could you post that
in the group chat?

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.190
No, I'm sure she didn't notice.
She's surprisingly oblivious.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.660
Why'd you buy so much?

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.130
It was a buy two, get one free deal.
It'll be fun if we all use them!

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.870
- Come on, we're late. Let's go.
- Okay.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:08.370
Give it here. I'll put it in my bag.

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.080
(My birthday)

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:33.630
(Happy birthday, Ms. Jung.
We'll give you a 20-percent discount...)

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:56.850
Gosh.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.280
What?

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:42.360
- Da Hae.
- You...

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.140
What are you doing here?

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.050
I'm sorry, Da Hae. I was just...

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.680
too ashamed to face you.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:04.120
Right.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.150
You should be.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.960
Showing up after what felt like
24 years.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.820
No, that's not right.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.230
- It's only been a day.
- Every hour felt like a year.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.330
I'm so sorry. I'm really so sorry.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.370
You should have said that yesterday.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:31.710
You should have come back to me...

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.950
and said, "I don't love you enough
to marry you. I'm sorry."

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.550
You should've done all that
yesterday.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.990
I'm sorry,
but please don't misunderstand me.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.190
I do love you.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.930
But the more I love you,

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.660
the more I'll just feel like
something's missing.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:51.600
What?

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:53.570
I've thought about this a lot.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.100
What would happen if we got married?

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:58.210
Would things still be this good?

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.140
Could we actually be happy?

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.440
But we're not going to make it.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:05.880
And why wouldn't we?

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.980
We both came from nothing.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:12.120
If we marry, we'll have to work
way harder just to get by.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.260
- Do you think you can handle that?
- Hey!

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.320
Why not?

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.390
I have a job too.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.460
You're a temp.

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.830
There's no room for advancement.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.400
On your salary, can you even make
a dent in your student loans?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.970
And what if you get pregnant
after we're married?

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.640
You'd be pressured into
quitting your job anyway.

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:35.210
How can we raise a kid on my income?

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:36.210
Stop it.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:38.110
I'd have to kill myself working.

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:39.150
I said, stop it.

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.250
And even then,
we couldn't afford a place in Seoul.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.320
Not even a decent home
where we could feel secure for once.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.690
We'd just be scraping by,

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:49.490
slaving away like animals
until we retire.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.930
Maybe that passes for
an "average" life to you.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:53.590
Well, I'm so done with that life!

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.060
Gosh. Hey...

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:03.940
Goodness.

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.110
If you're going to say all that,

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.550
at least get me drunk first.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.090
It's seriously hard to take in...

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.790
when I'm sober.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:26.630
I'm really sorry, but...

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.970
Are you crying?

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:34.800
I'm not crying because of you.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.700
I'm crying for me.

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:40.070
Because I'm so pathetic.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.480
My life was so pitiful that I had
no choice but to fall for you.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.050
Someone like you was the best
I could do.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.590
My...

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:55.860
My life...

00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.690
is just so pathetic.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.100
Da Hae. Wait...

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:07.900
Move.

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.750
Surprise!

00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.690
Happy birthday!

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:35.100
- Happy birthday
- Happy birthday

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.860
Happy birthday...

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.940
(Christmas Flea Market is Open!)

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.390
I've seen myself like this before.

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:43.660
Was it a dream?

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.170
Or was it a premonition
of this awful, repetitive reality?

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:50.370
Either way,

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:54.610
life is awful.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:06.890
Come on out.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.070
Gosh.

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.250
Gosh, stop smacking your lips.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.090
You see,

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.130
- it's something I read somewhere.
- Yes?

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:49.530
I think they say a breakup is...

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.930
when it's time to part
and you just go your own way.

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.270
So as for who got the better deal...

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.540
I don't know, Jesus? Buddha?

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.010
Anyway, they say only
the Almighty knows. That...

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.580
Socrates, or was it Pilates?

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:06.710
- Anyway, one of them said it.
- What are you even talking about?

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.850
Hey.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.680
How can you not recall a short line
and just stumble through it?

00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.550
I just wanted to say
something to help.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.260
She's crying so hard.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.300
Da Hae.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.870
Stop crying already!

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.400
Is this really worth crying over?

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:35.280
Should I do a happy dance
because it's all-out mayhem?

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:37.610
Don't waste your tears on that jerk.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:40.310
Focus on something more productive.

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.380
Something that'll actually help you
in life.

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:45.950
Something more ambitious, you know?
Forward-thinking.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.950
For example,
something like crypto...

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.290
This isn't right, Eun Sang.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.290
Why do you keep interrupting me?

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.560
I just really feel like
I have to say this.

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:03.870
Are you serious?

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.510
Hey, honey. Yes, I just got done.

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:16.980
Well, it was a bit of a headache,

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:19.020
but I took care of it.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.950
Should I meet you there?

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.960
See you in a bit. Love you.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:27.960
That son of a...

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.330
I'm going to grab that jerk,

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:34.100
dunk him in the Han River
head, shoulders, knees, and toes...

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.840
and make suyuk out of him!
That jerk!

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.870
You jerk!

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.740
Gosh, why are you being so vicious?

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.380
Hey,
You share locations with him, right?

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.980
Track him down right now.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.450
Well, he's had his phone turned off
this whole time.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:55.560
But why?

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.960
Since everything's
all-out mayhem anyway,

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:02.600
let's go
do that happy dance for real.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.260
What?

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:13.210
You know what?

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:17.280
The walk signal here stays on
for way more than a minute.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:19.780
Really?

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.080
So?

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.750
What can we do with all that time?

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.060
What are you getting at?

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:33.330
What?

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:36.130
Your hair is so soft.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.640
- What?
- And it smells really good.

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.610
- Hey, what is that?
- What? What's the problem?

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:46.670
Look over there.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.760
("Red Flavor,"

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:15.270
(Lee Byeong Jun,
you're just so awful)

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.510
(You're all talk,
but you just keep showing off)

00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:23.280
(Being with you is absolute torture)

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:27.150
(What makes you so cocky
when you've got nothing to show for it?)

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:30.820
(Your face looks like
a wad of chewed-up gum)

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.720
(No, that's an insult to the gum)

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.750
Change it.

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:38.490
(Then you should at least have
a good personality)

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:41.530
(Or be loaded, like you always say)

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:42.630

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:59.280
You good-for-nothing!

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:06.750
Isn't that your name?

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.690
Yes, that's my name.

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:20.800
- Gosh!
- Hey!

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:26.010
The guy who hated
subway transfers...

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:29.280
- is quick with this transfer.
- Transfer?

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.210
- Hey, am I your rebound?
- No, that's not what this is.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.480
- No, not even close.
- What?

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.120
A guy who couldn't get it up.
Do you call that a relationship?

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.360
- It was charity.
- Jung Da Hae! What did you say?

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:43.690
Speaking of which,

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:46.290
you know
the special meal you missed?

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.960
- What?
- I'll give it to you now.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.030
Eat this!

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.170
- Sun Hwa!
- Hey!

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.510
- Gosh, that's cold.
- You think I'm the one losing out?

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:06.710
You weren't good enough
for me either, you jerk!

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.380
You go, girl! You go!
That was awesome.

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:20.960
Darn it...

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:24.330
Darn it!

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.240
No way.

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:37.210
(Bareun Snack's Sinsa Tteokbokki)

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.480
Is that the spicy flavor?

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:40.280
It was absurd.

00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:44.720
What are you doing?
Now you just waltz in here...

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:47.290
and crash?

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.990
Just for tonight.

00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:53.130
Why leave your fancy house
to cause trouble here all the time?

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.960
Where have I seen her before?

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.230
Who?

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.730
- A woman?
- A warrior.

00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:03.370
With guts like that,
she's a total warrior.

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.670
What are you talking about?

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.650
Hey, did you guys see that?

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.690
- Hey.
- Darn, I should've recorded that.

00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:30.960
That's hilarious.

00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:01.960
Still, it's your birthday,
so we have to celebrate.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.100
- Birthday party time.
- Yes!

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.970
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.970
Happy birthday.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.440
Okay, make a wish.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.980
A wish?
Just to live a normal, quiet life.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.620
But my life is just so...

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.590
Why does it have to be so hard?

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:29.390
So, I'm not asking
for anything special.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.620
This life is beyond saving.

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.590
It feels like a losing game already.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.670
Let's all go home. It's cold.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:43.870
Hey, wait!

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:45.570
- What about the cake?
- Wait for us.

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:47.210
- At least eat some before you go.
- Wait for us.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.310
- Let's eat it before we go.
- Wait for us.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.080
- Hey, we need to pack this up.
- Oh, the cake...

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.210
Just put it all in here.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.830
You guys,
I need to tell you something.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.300
Oh, no. We're done for.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.070
What is it now?
Why do you always have to interrupt?

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:16.540
No, look over there.
That's a shortcut.

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:20.810
We have to go this way
if we want to catch the last train.

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:23.810
Hey, wait up! Seriously.

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:29.550
- Hey!
- Hey, be careful!

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.850
Gosh, wait up!

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:35.490
- Here, grab my hand.
- My gosh.

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.060
Oh, my.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.090
Hold on!

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:43.260
Hey! Ji Song! Gosh, seriously.

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.300
Are you okay?

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.770
Yes, I'm fine.
Why did you suddenly run off?

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.740
- Gosh, seriously.
- Get up. Don't sit.

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:56.640
- Hey...
- Careful.

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:59.150
The last train. Hurry!

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.450
Oh, no. The cake!

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.990
Darn it! Nothing ever goes my way.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.060
Every single thing...

01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:17.730
is just completely ruined. Darn it!

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.030
- It's not ruined!
- Gosh, you scared me!

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.300
Why are you yelling?

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.470
We have it too!

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.340
What do you mean? What do we have?

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.810
Something to turn this all around.

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.510
Our ace in the hole!

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.910
A shot?

01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:36.750
I've only ever been
on the receiving end.

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:41.450
Even as this cruel world
kept knocking my teeth out,

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:46.230
I believed this misery was my fate
because I had nothing.

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.360
But now, Eun Sang is telling me...

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:58.040
that we have a shot too.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.010
A knockout punch
to obliterate this painful reality.

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:06.010
She's saying it's ours
for the taking.

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.060
She's flying.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.700
She's flying?

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.750
Guys, let's...

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:48.920
Back then, I had no idea...

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.720
that this moment...

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.290
Let's get into crypto!

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.660
would change our destinies.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.780
Just give me the chance.

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:14.650
I'll be a dedicated Marron employee.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.020
Ms. Jung Da Hae.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.120
In three years,

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.960
- how do you think you'll be living?
- Sorry?

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.060
Your wish, so to speak?

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:30.000
You have a vision
for your future, right?

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.470
What do you think it'll be like
in three years?

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.300
I just...

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:38.970
want to live a normal, average life.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.810
Average...

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:42.680
is boring.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.010
- I'm out of questions.
- What's "average" to you?

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:48.980
Well, I'm not entirely sure,

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:53.920
but a life
where you get immediate care...

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.490
if you get stung by a bee?

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.690
The truth is, right now,

01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.830
I'm in a lot of pain.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.860
But I'm afraid that if I leave now,
I won't get the job.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.730
And if that happens,
starting next month,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.400
I'll be struggling to even pay
my health insurance.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.570
So, something that might seem
boringly obvious to someone else...

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.440
is a matter of desperation for me.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.380
Right now,
my life feels pretty miserable.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.820
So, I hope that in three years,
I won't be like this anymore,

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.190
so I can live that average life...

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.390
where money
isn't making me miserable.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.130
So, couldn't you please
just hire me?

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.290
So, if you just get the job,

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.030
you think you'll be able
to live the life you want?

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.170
Yes, of course.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.900
I'll be earning money.

01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:50.540
(To the Moon)

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:20.470
Do you think I'm like you?
Blinded by a get-rich-quick fantasy?

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:22.540
Do I look like the type of person
who'd get into crypto?

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.610
I swore I wouldn't, but I bought it.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.550
Nothing ever goes my way.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.410
Not one single thing.

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:29.780
Dr. Ham?

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.520
Didn't you say you saw him
during your job interview?

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.720
I doubt
he'd even remember me, though.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.760
I interviewed you
three years ago, right?

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.330
So what if I like him?

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:41.330
Is there some reason I can't?

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.800
