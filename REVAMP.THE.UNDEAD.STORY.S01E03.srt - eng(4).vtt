Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.250
They’ve killed everyone else in the Jonoel bloodline.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.260
I can now confirm they’re the ones

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.040
who vandalized the painting at the gallery to break the curse.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.990
And now you still want to trust humans?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.190
Enough, Ciar.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.170
It’s alright, Punn.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.510
I’ll protect you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.790
SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.840
Male humans taste horrible.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.380
Your lipstick is smudged.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.980
Right here.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
There’s a red stain.

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.970
Would you do me the honor of
having a drink with me, pretty vampire?

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.260
So it’s your group

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.260
who’s been hunting and killing my family.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.260
So what?

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.950
I’ll show you what a real hunter is.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.850
Why the hell were you shooting nonstop?

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.880
We have limited bullets.

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.350
It took me a long time to create each one.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.409
Why the hell did you slap me?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.980
I was shooting for you.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.630
She got away because of you, idiot!

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.290
You missed all the vital spots, dumbass!

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.970
My bullets are great.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.110
Only one good shot would’ve killed her.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.210
They’re great, my ass!

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.210
She ran the hell away!

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.650
If you guys want to fight,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.710
go back to the House and do it there.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.660
What did I tell you?

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.230
You need to focus on the field.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.200
Don’t mess around.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.320
How many times have I told you?

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.500
You need to focus on the field.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.370
Are you alright?

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.200
I’ll be fine once my wound is disinfected.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.550
Then I’ll only have the sprained ankle left.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.310
I’m sorry I failed, Jett.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.370
A pure-blood vampire is really powerful.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.820
The crafted bullets you let me try
didn’t work, Caster.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.030
See? She said they didn’t work, idiot.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.420
I’m not wrong.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.940
Damn it.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.500
We let the target get away like that.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.980
Would he be able to handle her on his own?

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.550
Pure-blood vampires are really dangerous.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.980
Don’t worry.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.440
There’s no way that vampire will make it.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.320
Mr. Ramil, you don’t have to
keep staring at me.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.950
I told you Mr. Mekhin already treated me.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.900
The external wounds aren’t visible anymore.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.470
But Mekhin can’t heal your internal wounds.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.230
Mr. Ramil, what are you doing?

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.330
Hey!

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.750
I’m healing the wounds in your heart.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.600
You must’ve been so shocked.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.290
It’s alright now.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.710
I’ll always protect you
for as long as you want me to.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.960
Mr. Ramil,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.290
why are you protecting me so much?

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.160
It’s because my blood can help
restore your powers, isn’t it?

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.240
No, Punn.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.060
You matter more than that.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.720
How?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.240
To me, you…

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.100
May I come in?

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.120
You may not!

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.260
Hey!

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.370
Mr. Methus, please come in.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.670
Well…

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.860
Did I come in at a bad time?

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:05.980
- Yes.
- No.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.490
What is it?

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.710
Ciar is awake now, Master.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.590
Feel free to scold

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.590
or punish me any way you want,

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.420
but don’t give me the silent treatment.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.680
It’s uncomfortable.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.860
You’re the one who has to apologize.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.250
Do you even realize what you’ve done?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.040
What?

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.680
How are they?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.270
The ones you saved
have minor injuries, Master.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.310
The one Mr. Punn saved is badly injured,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.990
but he’s out of danger now.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.640
I made sure everyone is resting
and being monitored at Mekhin’s hospital.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.940
Once you get all your powers back,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.500
we can find a way to deal with the situation.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.780
Mmm.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.660
Thank you so much, you two.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.620
And…

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.040
Thank you, too, Ciar,

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.350
for still listening to me enough

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.730
and not killing all those humans
like you said you would.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:17.410
But I still stand by my word
that I don’t agree with your rule at all.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.530
Humans don’t have a rule about killing us.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.650
We shouldn’t have a rule
about sparing their lives either.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.340
Not all humans are evil, Ciar.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.960
You’re saying

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.760
Punn is not like the others, aren’t you?

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.620
What kind of good person

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.580
would agree to live with a vampire?

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.940
You trust humans too much.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.750
You’re crossing the line, Ciar.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.270
Well,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.710
I’ll keep your concern in mind.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.210
What? Who says I’m worried about you?

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.690
I just don’t have a good feeling
about your guy.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.330
Alright.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.720
Let’s talk about restoring powers
to our Master.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.090
Ciar.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.930
Mekhin.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.700
When will you two be ready
to perform the ritual?

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.460
How do you know I like roses?

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.540
If I told you I have the power to read minds,

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.520
would you believe me?

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.350
Then…what am I thinking right now?

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.700
I actually have a dream.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.540
I dreamed of having a small, peaceful house

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.750
where I could grow flowers,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.010
sit down to watch the sunset,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.970
and live a simple life

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.960
with someone I love.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.230
Is this place like what you dream of?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.670
Do you like it here?

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.780
Are you trying to ask me to stay?

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.220
Or…

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.010
do you have the power to read my mind?

00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.800
Hmm?

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.500
Well, can I ask you to stay?

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:17.010
Don’t you think it’s weird
for an ordinary human to live with a vampire?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.850
You’re saying

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.100
Punn is not like the others, aren’t you?

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.240
What kind of good person

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.980
would agree to live with a vampire?

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.880
I don’t think it’s weird.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.180
What do you think?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.480
Here.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.410
Can I keep in touch with you sometimes?

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.630
I don’t want you to disappear.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.320
Even if you don’t stay here,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.700
can I at least hear your voice and text you?

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.460
Do you know how to use it?

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.570
You can teach me.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.230
Teach me.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.550
I’ll save my number first.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.130
Hey, don’t shoot randomly!

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.730
We have limited bullets.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.720
Before you worry about the bullets,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.540
why don’t you worry about my life?

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.720
You idiot!

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.599
The first type of bullet is made from
sacred ore.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.810
They’re gold bullets that release
the power of light when fired.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.690
It limits the enemies’ movements.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.310
They should be temporarily paralyzed,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.609
making it easier for us to target them.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.540
The second type of bullet
is made mainly from silver ore.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.830
One shot is all it takes.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.830
No need to waste bullets.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:03.790
(Idiot!)

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.100
You bastard!

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.660
I almost died!

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.690
Give me a little more time
to finish developing the bullets.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.620
I think I can take all of them out.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.340
Don’t worry.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.330
What do you think, Jett?

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.640
Try to improve your bullets.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.740
As for your plan to develop other weapons,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.470
send me the file and I’ll forward it to Jett.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.500
Jett.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.630
Am I supposed to die
before you finish developing the bullets?

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.100
Jett.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.650
Jett, stop.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.210
Where are you going?

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.110
I don’t want to wait anymore.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.110
I’m going to kill him myself.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.990
If we can kill a leader like him,

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.710
we can put an end to all of this, Elise.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:02.220
Do you realize Ramil is not like
the other vampires we’ve killed before?

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.470
Jett, I know you’re hurting

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.230
and very anxious right now,

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.770
but you have to be more patient.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.390
If we lose you, it’s over for all of us.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.440
Please, Jett. Can you stick to our plan?

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.370
If you want any more information,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.370
I’ll find it for you.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.580

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.700
SORRY, WE’RE TEMPORARILY CLOSED.
(Sorry, it’s not possible to reach
the number you’ve dialed at the moment.)

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.290
(Sorry, it’s not possible to reach
the number you’ve dialed…)

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.550
WHERE ARE YOU, PUNN?
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.340
Um…

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.790
Excuse me.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.540
Excuse me.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.260
Do you still have any grape jelly candy left?

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.940
Just a moment. I’ll restock the shelf for you.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.640
You like grapes, Doctor?

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.040
Yes, eating them calms my mind.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.710
Whenever I get a lot of accident cases,

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.710
I freak out a bit.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.000
So I have to eat the grape jelly candy.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.790
It’s like drinking wine to comfort myself,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.900
so I can focus on my patients.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.290
You’re not afraid of blood, are you?

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.980
What kind of doctor is afraid of blood?

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.420
None.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.530
I thought you were afraid of the blood
from the accident patients.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.970
The total is 139 baht and 50 satang.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.560
Okay.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.970
Done.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.100
I’m sorry for restocking the shelf late.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:47.980
Next time, I’ll make sure your favorite
grape jelly candy is fully stocked.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.790
Thanks.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.250
POKPONG

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.400
Here.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.540
Hold out your hand, Pokpong.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.940
How do you know my name?

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.980
Oh, my nametag.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:14.250
Here you go.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.990
You’re still a student. Smoking is bad.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.020
Whenever you want to smoke,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.420
try eating that instead.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.390
I’m going now.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.300
Don’t worry. I’ve been through that.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.110
It actually doesn’t hurt that much.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.760
I’m not afraid of the pain.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.670
I just don’t like that.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.500
What kind of vampire is afraid of blood?

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.420
How embarrassing.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.100
It smells good.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.890
When we perform the ritual, make sure
to hide the smell of your blood well.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.660
If I lose control,

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.340
you’ll lose all the blood in your body.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.340
Ciar.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.760
Don’t worry, Punn.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.810
We have Methus.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.930
What happened last time
won’t happen again.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.950
Don’t be afraid, Mr. Punn.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.860
After the ritual,

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.480
I’ll deal with those two.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.340
What do you want me to do?

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:55.060
Can you stay and take care of me?

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.100
Yes.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.500
Let’s go, Master.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.520
It’s time for the ritual.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.520
Be honest, Mr. Ramil.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.580
How do you know I like roses?

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.430
You really don’t believe I can read minds?

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.370
Your scent

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.800
is like this rose.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.940
I don’t smell anything.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.200
A vampire’s sense of smell is spot-on.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.430
You smell like roses.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.300
Whenever I see them, I think of you.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.570
Alright, I’ll believe you.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.540
What are you doing?

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.890
You say roses make you think of me.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.340
So I want to take some photos
to look at when I think of you.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.100
You won’t be able to capture me.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.200
But I can take photos of you.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.120
Do you know how to do that?

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.220
I’m just going to do what you do.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.410
Do it properly.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.050
Here. Position the camera like this
and press the button in the middle.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.620
Press the button in the middle.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.240
Hey.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.980
How many photos are you going to take?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.080
That’s enough.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.170
It’s me, Methus.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.540
Yes?

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.770
I’m here about Master Ramil.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.770
He’s worn out and resting in his room.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.970
Could you go and take care of him?

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.950
I’m going to take care of the other two.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.740
Okay.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.000
Hey!

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.100
Let go of me!

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.290
Hey! I thought you said
the ritual would wear you out.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.110
Hey!

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.140
Hey!

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.310
Ouch!

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.550
Hey.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.240
Ugh.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.890
Hey.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.660
What are you doing?

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.460
Let go of me! Hey!

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.710
Weren’t you going to give me
a morning kiss?

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.950
What are you talking about?

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.570
We’re not a thing.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.050
Then do you want to try being something?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.140
Hey.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.130
No.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:10.900
Hey.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.900
Let go of me.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.140
I’ll let go of you

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.940
if you give me something in return.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.420
If you let me…

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.960
pinch your cheeks,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.440
I’ll let go of you nicely.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.770
What?

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.610
No way.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.880
Then…

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.970
Give me a morning kiss instead.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.680
Hey.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.720
Fine.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.220
I’ll let you pinch my cheeks,

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.300
but only once,

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:03.700
and only for five seconds.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:04.820
Okay.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.180
One.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:16.640
Two.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.310
Three.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:21.570
Four.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.460
Five.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.470
Ugh.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.100
Ouch.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:26.900
Ugh.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.950
POKPONG: WHERE ARE YOU, PUNN?
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.270
I’M ON A WORK TRIP IN ANOTHER CITY.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.960
SORRY FOR NOT TELLING YOU.
PLEASE DON’T WORRY.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.620
Who are you texting?

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.640
I’m sorry, Mr. Ciar, but that’s personal.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.220
You’re full of secrets.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.300
Just don’t let me catch you red-handed.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.540
I have sharp senses and a keen nose.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.700
What’s wrong?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.180
Why are you afraid to face our Master?

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.950
Why are you avoiding his eyes?

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.470
Did you do something wrong?

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.460
What are you talking about, Ciar?

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:13.410
I saw this human texting someone.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.540
I was texting my younger brother.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.860
He’s worried because I’ve been missing.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.550
I haven’t reached out to him.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.460
You’re lying.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.690
My gut tells me you were texting the hunters.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:32.410
You’d better confess you’re one of them.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:42.340
I promise I won’t kill you…cruelly.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.980
POKPONG: WHERE ARE YOU, PUNN?
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.960
I’M ON A WORK TRIP IN ANOTHER CITY.
SORRY FOR NOT TELLING YOU.
PLEASE DON’T WORRY.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.110
Ciar,

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.460
you shouldn’t accuse anyone without proof.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.900
Fine.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.620
I’ll find the proof.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.810
Please excuse me. I need to go on duty.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.230
Please excuse me as well.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.520
I have an appointment today.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.670
Can I ask you something?

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.740
Can I trust you right now?

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.410
I don’t have to prove anything.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.740
If you want to kill me,

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.680
you’ll need to pierce the center of my heart
with pure silver ore.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.500
But my skin is as strong as armor right now,

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:58.140
so the best weapon would be a silver knife.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.090
Why are you telling me this?

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.420
Because I want you to know that I trust you.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.659
My life is in your hands now.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:49.530
This painting is called Moonstruck.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:51.850
I know the owner.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.719
If you’re interested, I can introduce you.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.350
You asked to meet me.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.830
Is there something you want to discuss?

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.980
Our gallery is preparing for a new exhibition,

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:10.870
so Mr. Jett wanted me to reach out and see
if you had a collection that fits our theme.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.980
Haven’t you guys had enough
after the last incident?

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.920
You’re a very funny man, Mr. Methus.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.930
By the way,

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.420
is the restoration work finished?

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.060
I haven’t been able to contact the team.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.350
I told you I’d handle it myself.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.800
That means you guys don’t need to know any of my business anymore.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.390
Is there anything else?

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.340
If not, please excuse me.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.430
Can I talk to you about those guys
I sent you two days ago?

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.380
Can you tell me

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.580
how they’re doing right now?

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.500
I’ve fixed the frame and replaced the mirror.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:59.470
As for the painting underneath, I painted over the original based on what I remember.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.820
Feel free to take a look
and let me know if it looks okay to you.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.410
Are you really going to leave this place?

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.750
My part in your power-restoring ritual is done

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.900
and I’ve finished restoring the painting.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.220
I don’t need to be here anymore.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.550
What if I asked you to create
a new painting of me?

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.380
Would that buy me more time to be with you?

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.580
But I don’t have any more canvases.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.670
You can use your notebook.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.690
Headshot, baby!

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.540
Can you take a photo of me?

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:24.530
Of course.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.960
I almost went blind. How’s the photo?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.900
Amazing.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.940
Hey, let’s go fill our glasses.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.190
Let’s keep drinking.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.180
Whoa, it’s only early evening
and you’re already getting drunk?

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:57.660
Where’s Jett?

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.250
He’s probably in his office.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:04.870
I don’t know. I haven’t seen him all day.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:09.640
Cheers.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.150
Yeah.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:11.030
Come on.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.740
Jett.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.800
Where are you?

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.800
Is something urgent?

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.240
(Everyone we sent on the mission
is still alive.)

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.640
What do you mean?

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.680
(They didn’t kill our family.)

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.690
Jett, they’re here.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:15.710
Elise!

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.700
Is it because of what Ciar said?

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.280
Is that why you’re leaving?

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.700
There’s a reason why he hates humans.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.500
I’ve told you before, right?

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:17.020
Ciar, Mekhin, and Methus
were once humans.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.800
Methus was a prince and an army leader.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.660
In his final days as a human,

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:32.740
he was betrayed by a soldier he trusted.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.380
So I gave him eternal life.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:48.310
Since then, Methus swore to serve me
and follow my rules strictly.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.020
As for poor Ciar,

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.020
he was just a slave
who was lured to be killed.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:02.230
Those humans believed bathing in innocent children’s blood preserved their youth.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.800
Methus was the one who found him.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.580
I told Ciar he’d be alright

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.460
and gave him a new life.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:18.460
Since then, he’s loved me
and followed my lead.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.570
What about Mr. Mekhin?

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.800
Mekhin was a combat medic.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.820
He was shot while saving a fellow soldier.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.580
His wound became infected,

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:37.900
causing excruciating pain,

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:42.260
but he tried to travel home
to say goodbye to his family.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.960
So we helped him.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:50.580
But Mekhin didn’t know
how to control his instincts back then.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.400
Instead of saying goodbye to his family,

00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.600
he ended all their lives.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.160
So, did you get the solid proof
you were looking for?

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.380
They all deserve sympathy.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:17.270
But you know who’s the most pitiful, Punn?

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:24.460
It’s me.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.900
I’ll become the most pitiful vampire

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.350
if you decide to leave me in the end.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.240
Even if you have no reason to stay here,

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.340
can you please stay with me?

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.330
Why, Mr. Ramil?

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.440
Why do you want me
to stay here with you so much?

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.160
If I told you how I feel,

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.270
would you believe me?

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.930
Give it a try,

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:33.500
and then I’ll decide what to do.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.860
Alright, Mr. Ramil.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.970
I’ll stay here with you.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.280
Thank you, Punn.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.510
IT’S TIME FOR YOU
TO DEAL WITH THE TARGET, PUNN.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:26.540
Jett.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:31.090
It’s very late. Why are you back here?

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.970
Don’t worry, Father.

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.060
By the time you wake up,

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:50.750
I’ll have annihilated all those vampires.

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.700
Especially that filthy Jonoel bloodline.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:46:58.190
I promise.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:46:59.900
Hey!

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:01.150
Hey!

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.140
Hey, I’m cold.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.180
You like Mr. Punn very much, don’t you?

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:22.700
I’m going home for a bit.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.880
I’ll be back as soon as I can.
