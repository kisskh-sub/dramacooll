How's it going? Is she back yet?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.600
No.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.519
Not yet.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.960
Fengying

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.199
has always been so kind.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.519
How could she do that?

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.440
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.320
Leaving her child behind.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.280
What terrible influence.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.120
How can they cope?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.439
Right.

00:00:38.432 --> 00:00:39.328
Exactly.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.239
Dad, what's wrong?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.840
Do you know where your mother went?

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:32.680
No, Dad.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.640
Did she say anything to you?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.840
No.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.560
You didn't go to school today?

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.199
I...

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.879
I wanted to go out to play for a bit.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.680
Where's Mom?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.159
You don't have a mom now.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.680
Someone like her

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.640
isn't worthy to be your mom.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.680
But... Mom...

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.240
She's not your mom!

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.879
Dad.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.039
She isn't worthy!

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.520
She ran off with another man!

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.000
She abandoned us, understand?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.840
Understood.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.960
Where's Grandma?

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.879
She is in the hospital.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.800
Tang.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.840
From now on, it'll be

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.479
only us in this family.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.879
Dad.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.680
Your mom left us, understand?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.520
Understood.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.639
She's the one who abandoned us.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.360
I got it, Dad.

Officer.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.000
The kidnapping case.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.520
Wasn't everything clarified?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.479
Why hasn't Tang Yixun been released yet?

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.479
We're still investigating this case.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.159
How much longer will it take?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.960
How are his injuries?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.680
Focus on your recovery.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.720
We'll inform the family of any updates.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.360
I am his family.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.439
Can you tell me where he is now?

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.400
The rain's stopped.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.519
You should go home now.

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:27.519
If there's any news,

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.000
we'll contact you immediately.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.960
Okay?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.720
When will there be news?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.360
Why are you still here?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.680
Go home and rest early.

Is everything okay now?

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.479
Yes.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.760
I'm sorry.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.160
It's okay.

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.279
At worst, I'll just have a scar.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.319
It'll make me look intimidating.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.080
It's okay.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.039
It's okay.

Home.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.080
Okay.

My dad wants
to invite you and Ye Haitang

for a thank-you meal.

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.000
Without your rescue,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.039
I'd be burned to death.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:46.879
No need at all.

00:09:47.719 --> 00:09:48.559
We're all safe.

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:49.399
That matters most.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.440
Besides,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.080
we'll be awkward.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.720
Okay, I won't pressure you.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.559
My mom consulted the school,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.919
but your detention record
disqualifies you.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.039
No exceptions at all.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:02.519
Maybe my mom could

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:03.639
ask other schools for you?

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:04.479
No, no.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.960
I've decided

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:08.519
to find a job.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.399
Ye Haitang will go to college.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.039
College costs a fortune.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.080
I must save up for her.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.600
You can work at my dad's nightclub.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600
I'll ask my dad

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.440
to make you manager.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.480
Stop it.

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:21.679
That is not

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:23.120
a reputable place.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.840
I want honest labor

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.759
and clean money.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.240
True, that den reeks of trouble.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.919
Nightly drunken brawls.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.720
Take this cash for now.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.600
If you need more,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.440
I'll go to my mom.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.560
Shen Xiaojun,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.080
what's this about?

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:55.399
Think I'm a beggar?

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.359
No,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.720
just my New Year money.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.200
Not much. I want to thank you both.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.040
No need at all.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.240
Treat Ye Haitang well

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.519
at school from now on.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:03.639
Don't worry.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.759
In Meiwan High School,

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:06.639
if she loses a hair,

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:07.840
it will be my failure.

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:09.519
As long as I'm around,

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.200
nobody at Meiwan High School
will bully Ye Haitang.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:13.719
Deal.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.879
I never expected

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:19.440
we'd end up like this.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.440
What twisted fate.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.320
This will help you.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.840
My mom hired an expensive tutor.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.600
Ye Haitang can join me.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.159
Tutoring won't fix my grades,

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.360
but she's different.

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:39.559
She's already smart.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:40.919
With extra help,

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.639
she'll get into a good college.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.039
That works?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.759
Absolutely.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.919
Bring her tomorrow

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:47.960
to the tutor with me.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.759
My mom's spent a lot on it.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.919
May as well share it.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240
And I can slack off.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.559
Great, thanks.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.800
Really?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.440
Shen Xiaojun offered himself.

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:04.360
Seems like

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:06.600
good karma is paying off.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.720
Blessing in disguise, right?

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.240
Now, I'll get into a top college.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.040
Tang,

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:15.320
from now on, focus on studying.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.799
I'll earn money.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.759
No matter which college you enter,

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:21.639
I'll have your tuition covered

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:22.519
with plenty to spare.

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.639
You'll enter college in style.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.360
Don't overwork yourself.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.799
I'll go to a normal school.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.360
I asked Miss Tan.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.799
It is tuition-free

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:33.159
and offers living allowances.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.080
Really?

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:35.719
That's fantastic.

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:38.080
Your money can fund
another year of high school.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.799
College is still important.

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:40.799
Wouldn't it be better

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:42.480
to work after graduating?

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.480
What career interests you?

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.320
I...

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:46.399
I'm flexible.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.480
I'll study whatever brings profit.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.519
When I make money,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.360
I'll take you traveling.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.399
Any place you want to visit?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.799
I want to see snowfall.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.960
I've never seen heavy snow.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960
Me neither.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.799
Then it's settled.

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:09.480
When I make money,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.720
we'll go wherever snow falls.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.200
Deal.

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:36.080
Thanks.

00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:50.879
Young man,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.360
you're too skinny.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.600
Can you handle it?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.120
Of course I can.

00:13:58.559 --> 00:13:59.399
I mean,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.080
you're still young.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.200
Too young for this.

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:03.399
Let me handle it.

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.840
Don't push your limits.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.680
Listen.

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.480
Unload this truck, and you can go.

00:14:08.039 --> 00:14:09.799
Wait, isn't there another ship coming?

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:11.720
You want to continue?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.560
Yes.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.440
Don't come crying if you collapse.

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:16.519
It won't happen.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.840
And we get extra pay after 10:00 PM.

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:21.080
You're too eager for cash.

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:22.639
Listen.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:26.519
There's a ship leaving for Shenzhen
at noon tomorrow.

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:28.240
They need one to manage cargo.

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:29.399
It takes a few days.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.840
Interested?

00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:31.999
Okay.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.480
I'll go if the pay's good.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.600
Money-hungry brat.

00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:56.896
(Math problems)

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.080
Five yuan.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.879
I hear there are
imported goods on that ship.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.000
Next.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.960
I've gone to look.

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:17.519
I expected cigarettes or alcohol,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.080
but when we opened the crates,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.440
it was all snacks and drinks.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.559
- Things for women and kids.
- Next.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:24.519
Not interested.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.440
Let's get fish noodles and drink later.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.280
Alright.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.080
Tang Yixun.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:30.840
15.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.680
Thanks, Mr. Guang.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.680
Thanks.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:35.719
Next.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.920
Huang Longshan.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.840
Six yuan.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.960
Young man,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.919
only these items left.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:53.799
What would you like?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.559
Let me look.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.160
What's this?

00:16:08.639 --> 00:16:09.879
Imported biscuits.

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:11.240
(Danish Cookie)
Biscuits?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.320
Cookies.

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:13.440
Better than biscuits.

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:15.039
Only two boxes left.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:15.879
Want them?

00:16:16.879 --> 00:16:18.639
Yes, I'll take both.

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:20.240
Ten yuan for two boxes.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.080
Ten's fine.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.039
Deal, no problem.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.080
Ten yuan.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.000
Here, thanks.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.840
Good.

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:38.999
Tang.

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:42.919
Listen,

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.639
Shen Xiaojun got detention.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.559
That's his usual routine.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:49.840
What did you get?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.280
This?

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.120
You'll find out at home.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.480
You have a secret.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.679
Tired today?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.559
Not really.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.519
Just some clothes today.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:04.359
Easy stuff.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.000
Good.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.440
(Danish Cookie)
This is for you.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.279
Biscuits in a box?

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.680
Not called biscuits.

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.319
It has a specific name.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.159
Cookie.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.280
Cookie.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.200
Right. Look how amazing this is.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.000
The cookies match exactly

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.880
with the packaging.

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:26.399
Exactly.

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:27.879
Cool, huh?

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.799
This looks so fancy.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.759
Where did you get it?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.640
It's expensive, right?

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:37.079
How expensive can cookies get anyway?

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:39.799
Sailors bought these overseas.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:41.400
They got extra stock and sold me some.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.839
I figured with all your schoolwork

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:45.240
and exams tiring you out.

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:47.920
You'd need some sweets.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.320
Try one.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.320
Here you are.

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:00.039
I can't bear to eat it.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:01.680
Don't fuss. I bought two boxes.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.520
Eat up. Hurry.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.040
How is it?

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.960
Delicious.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.800
Really?

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.640
Try it yourself.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.480
Okay.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.599
The box is pretty.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.800
Don't throw it away.

00:18:24.039 --> 00:18:25.640
We'll keep it for storage later.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.720
One for you and one for me.

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:29.159
Deal.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.400
I wish that mailbox hadn't gone missing.

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:38.920
I want to tell Yu Nian

00:18:39.279 --> 00:18:40.720
I'm taking the college exams soon.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.440
We'll leave Meiwan shortly.

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:46.240
I also want to ask her

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:47.920
if I ever find my mom.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.800
Tang.

00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:56.839
Something just occurred to me.

00:18:58.839 --> 00:19:00.000
Didn't you say before

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.200
you had a secret code with your mom,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.960
known only to you two?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.039
Later, in the future,

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:11.359
you told Shen Cheng, right?

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.480
That must be it.

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:19.839
Here's the catch.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.920
I keep wondering

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.480
why your son's surname is Shen.

00:19:23.759 --> 00:19:25.119
I've been racking my brains.

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:26.960
We only know one Shen,

00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:28.559
Shen Xiaojun.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.000
But you two aren't compatible.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.319
You're like oil and water.

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:32.279
But it's different now.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640
You've gotten closer.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.920
You even study with him daily.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.039
Tang, in the future...

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:37.160
Stop talking nonsense.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.240
I'm serious.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.119
The letter says so.

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:40.720
Your future son's surname is Shen.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.400
Shen Cheng, correct?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.760
Xun.

00:19:43.839 --> 00:19:45.319
That mailbox is already gone.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.039
It might not be true.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.359
I need to find that mailbox.

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:53.000
I must ask Shen Cheng directly

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
who his father really is.

00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:55.480
And Shen Xiaojun.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.640
He never studies.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.720
Why does he need a tutor?

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.400
Exactly. Saying it out loud,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.920
I find it suspicious.

00:20:01.279 --> 00:20:03.519
Why would he get a tutor
if he doesn't study?

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.559
Shen Xiaojun's fishy.

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:06.759
We're impossible.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.640
If that's impossible,

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.319
where did Shen Cheng

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:11.480
come from?

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.720
Why does he say you're his mom

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.280
and that he's your son?

00:20:14.599 --> 00:20:15.440
Isn't it strange?

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.079
And he knows your secret code...

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.039
I'll go look for the mailbox

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.359
at dawn tomorrow.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.640
Wait, why Shen?

00:20:38.119 --> 00:20:38.959
Here.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.279
Easy. Take it slow.

00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:42.399
Turn it around.

00:20:50.079 --> 00:20:51.240
That's enough for today.

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:52.279
Wang.

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:53.759
Haul the scrap metal away

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.840
when you leave.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.960
Got it.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.000
Bye, Mr. Guang.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.320
Sir,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.080
I'll handle it.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.960
You don't even know where the dump is.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.000
Let me do it.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.160
Don't worry. I can find it.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.759
You rest. Let me handle it.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.480
Take it easy, Tang.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.320
It's okay.

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:32.960
Tang!

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.640
Tang!

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.080
Look.

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:45.599
You found the mailbox!

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:47.599
I found it.

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:49.240
Don't move it alone. I'll come down.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.240
Tang, let go. I'll do it.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.679
Careful. You're not wearing gloves.

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:53.679
I'll do it.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.799
How did you find it?

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.320
I found it

00:23:03.119 --> 00:23:04.160
at a scrapyard.

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:06.599
Why did you go to the scrapyard?

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:09.359
Wait for me.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.599
I'll have some water and explain slowly.

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:25.640
I went to the scrapyard

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.559
to unload trash today.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.920
Then I heard a cat meowing.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.680
When I turned around, guess what?

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:32.680
It was that cat.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.799
You know that cat, right?

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:35.519
When I approached,

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:37.279
the cat was standing
right on this mailbox.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.599
Don't you find it magical?

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.359
It seems it's waiting for me.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.720
Check this out.

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:54.079
How did it get so damaged?

00:23:54.919 --> 00:23:55.759
I think

00:23:55.759 --> 00:23:57.319
the recent heavy rain

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.359
knocked over the mailbox.

00:23:59.799 --> 00:24:01.279
People thought it was abandoned,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.799
so they threw it away.

00:24:04.079 --> 00:24:04.919
Look.

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:06.920
It can't even stand upright.

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:08.399
Easy fix.

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:11.599
Tang.

00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:12.960
Go hold that side for me.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.800
I'll handle this.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.240
See?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.520
Almost done.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.759
You're amazing.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.960
After we fix this mailbox,

00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:34.039
let's keep it at home.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.160
If left outside,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.240
it may get damaged
by the weather or disappear again.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.279
What then?

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:40.480
But what if the cat doesn't come?

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.440
Will the mailbox still work?

00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:44.319
Putting it back is safer.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.359
You're right.

00:25:00.628 --> 00:25:07.328
(Sunshine Bookstore)

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:31.000
Why are you rushing, Tang?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.960
Let me walk you home.

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:33.599
I have things to do.

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:35.319
Xun will pick me up. You go back.

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:36.240
Alright.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.080
Tang.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.200
Xun, let's have dinner in a few days.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.520
See you tomorrow.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.079
See you tomorrow, Haitang.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.480
Bye-bye.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.000
Let's go.

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:52.559
Why is Shen Xiaojun

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.559
acting so strange?

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:57.039
He smiled at you

00:25:57.599 --> 00:25:58.599
very happily.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.240
Why was he smiling?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.400
What are you implying?

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.759
Stop being petty.

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:06.880
Who's being petty?

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.800
Just asking casually.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.359
No, he was really acting odd.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.759
See how he smiled just now.

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:18.079
Was he like this before?

00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:21.000
Shen Xiaojun

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.720
likes...

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.080
Wang Manyu.

00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:25.519
Really?

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:27.119
He just told me himself.

00:26:31.079 --> 00:26:32.319
That's nice.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.440
You know Wang Manyu.

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:36.960
Good grades, a kind personality,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.119
a pleasant voice,

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:39.400
and from a good family.

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:41.240
What do you mean?

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:45.000
Now, you're being petty, too.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:49.160
I mean,

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:51.960
they make a good match.

00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:55.599
Today, I told him to study hard

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.200
so that he can get into
the same university as Wang Manyu.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.240
That's his best chance.

00:26:59.599 --> 00:27:00.880
Shen Xiaojun...

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.160
Can he do it?

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:04.319
Of course he can.

00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:05.799
He got excited once he heard it.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:07.440
He didn't sleep during tutoring today.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.759
Good, showing some backbone.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.440
Did you bring the stationery?

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.760
Here it is.

00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:20.559
(Dear Shen Cheng.)

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:23.279
(It's hard to describe my feelings,)

00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:24.319
(but I believe)

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:26.640
(something miraculous
must have happened.)

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.119
(Tang Yixun is now my closest person.)

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.599
(Please trust he would never harm me.)

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.880
(Why would you say that?)

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:37.079
(Can you tell me in 2026,)

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:38.279
(what we'll be like?)

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:40.079
(One more thing.)

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:42.279
(Is your grandmother Wu Fengying?)

00:27:42.279 --> 00:27:43.480
I'll ask him something, too.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.799
(What's your dad's name?)
Asking this?

00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:56.000
I need to clarify it.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.279
You turned your back on me.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.440
Why?

00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:05.839
It's nothing.

00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:07.519
Just casually asking about the future.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:13.568
(Is he good to your mom?)

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.240
Done.

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:20.359
It's not time yet.

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:21.519
I'll put it in.

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:23.160
It'll be sent when the time comes.

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:39.639
W-What's wrong?

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.800
Tell me.

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:46.160
If the future turns out
different from what we imagined,

00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:48.599
can we still change it?

00:28:49.839 --> 00:28:51.039
Of course we can.

00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:54.200
We're literally communicating
with people from the future.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.160
What else is impossible?

00:28:58.359 --> 00:28:59.319
Don't worry.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.759
I won't let you marry Shen Xiaojun.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.839
Your son will never
take the Shen surname.

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:10.399
Tang.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.839
What does
your imagined future look like?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.119
In my imagined future,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.720
by 2026,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.960
we'd be in our fifties.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:29.200
We'd have traveled to many places

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.640
and done countless things we wanted.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.240
If we have no regrets,

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:36.559
then life is well-lived.

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:37.399
What about you?

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:38.480
Ever thought about it?

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.040
I...

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:42.279
I want to stay with you

00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:45.079
and go wherever you want to go

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:46.880
and do whatever you want to do.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.920
And I'll have no regrets.

00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:58.279
If we finish what we want to do

00:29:58.279 --> 00:30:00.640
by 50,

00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:02.079
what will we do

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:03.279
with all the remaining time?

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.200
We'll just keep looking at each other.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.599
Honestly, seeing you makes me happy.

00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:23.000
Looking at each other.

00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:25.279
Looking at each other.

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:42.799
Who are you looking for?

00:30:44.839 --> 00:30:46.240
I'm Shen Xiaojun's father.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.080
Shen Dashan.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:53.759
Take this money.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.480
Sir, we can't accept this.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.680
Is your mother Wu Fengying?

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.759
Your mom and I are old friends,

00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:05.640
so I'm your elder.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.799
When elders give you money,

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:08.359
you must accept it.

00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:09.880
You know my mom?

00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:11.599
More than just knowing.

00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:13.759
We are friends.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.200
Your mom was such a good person.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.599
When did you meet?

00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:17.839
When I first came to Meiwan,

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:20.440
I was just a reckless kid then.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.160
Determined to make it big.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400
But I had no real skills.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.680
So I got bold.

00:31:26.359 --> 00:31:28.640
The Fenghua Sugar Factory
was huge, right?

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.799
I thought there must be cash.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.519
I planned to steal some money there.

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.839
Fate's funny.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.559
Your mom was on duty that day.

00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:37.680
She caught me red-handed.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.160
She guarded the door fiercely,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.280
telling me,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.079
"Leave the money

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.759
and you can go free."

00:31:44.759 --> 00:31:47.599
Just then, security showed up.

00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:49.079
I thought, oh no.

00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:50.480
I was caught with the money.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.320
Right?

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.839
But then,

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:57.599
your mom quietly put the money away

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.240
and told security

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:03.480
I was her cousin
picking her up from work.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.000
So,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.400
your mom was my savior.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.440
But my mom...

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.119
She later took money from the factory.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.440
When I first heard about this,

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.440
I simply couldn't believe it.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.920
As my business grew more successful,

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:26.160
I invited her to work at my company.

00:32:26.519 --> 00:32:27.960
The pay would be much better,

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.039
but she refused.

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:30.119
I told her,

00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:31.119
"If you face trouble,

00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:33.319
come to me and I'll help however I can."

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:35.200
But she never asked me for anything.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.760
All these years,

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:39.079
she's only accepted
two tins of malted milk.

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:42.000
Malted milk?

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.599
No, no. Just take this malted milk.

00:32:46.359 --> 00:32:47.200
Mom.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.240
My mom rode in your car back then.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.599
You gave her that malted milk.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.800
Right.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.440
That was my fault.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.880
Once,

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.880
she asked me
to get her two boat tickets.

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:04.759
Something must have happened to her.

00:33:04.759 --> 00:33:06.240
If only I'd asked for more details...

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:08.599
My mother asked you
to buy two boat tickets?

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.599
When did that happen?

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.599
I don't recall the exact time.

00:33:13.119 --> 00:33:14.519
But not long after she asked me,

00:33:14.839 --> 00:33:16.559
that thing occurred.

00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:18.079
I wasn't there,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.240
but I specifically arranged for
someone to meet her at the dock.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.640
I had supplies ready for her.

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:24.640
But they told me

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:26.759
your mom didn't board.

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:29.240
I returned a few days later and went

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:30.839
to your house to see your dad.

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:34.039
I arrived just as loan sharks
were cornering him.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.359
He gambled

00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:38.000
and lost over 1,000 in one night,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.400
but he kept going

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.839
and borrowed more trying to win big.

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:43.400
So I...

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.680
I paid off his gambling debts.

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:47.400
1,000 yuan loss?

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.319
That was a huge sum

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.960
back then.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.359
Living with him all these years,

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.039
you must've suffered plenty.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.319
Tang

00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:00.720
has already cut ties with him.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:02.599
Good move.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.080
From now on,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.599
if you ever need help,

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:08.719
come to me.

00:34:09.759 --> 00:34:10.599
Thank you.

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:12.320
- Nothing.
- Thank you.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.440
But we really can't take

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:16.039
this money.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.120
We really can't.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.200
Alright.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:21.720
Your mother

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.079
saved me once.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.280
And you two

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.519
saved my son.

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:27.280
Our family owes you.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.720
Truly.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.920
Whatever difficulties you face,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.440
just tell me.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.320
We're family now.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.320
What are you doing?

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.760
Xun.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:45.999
Something's wrong.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:46.999
What is it?

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:51.000
He said Ye Yibo lost 1,000 yuan.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.599
How did he get that much?

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.440
Gamblers are all the same.

00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:56.199
Flush with cash today,

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.599
broke tomorrow.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.119
That director told my family

00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:04.039
my mom stole
a large sum from the factory.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.679
So you think

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:08.360
Ye Yibo's gambling money

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.159
was the same money your mom took?

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.320
I never believed my mom stole money

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.400
and ran off with someone.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.199
She wasn't that type.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.119
She asked for two tickets.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.840
She must've wanted to take me.

00:35:55.328 --> 00:35:57.632
(Pushui, Ning'an)

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.280
Fengying!

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:14.280
Wu Fengying!

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.000
Coming.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.480
Fengying, listen.

00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:19.519
The director said

00:36:19.519 --> 00:36:21.119
the supply cash arrived early.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.920
He wants all accounts sorted

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.199
and cash brought
to the office before 11:00 AM.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.320
11:00 AM today?

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.280
Not at the end of the month?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.239
Who could've known?

00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:31.159
The notice is issued.

00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:32.559
Don't be late at 11:00 AM.

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:33.399
I'm leaving now.

00:37:01.199 --> 00:37:02.280
Hurry up. We're late.

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:07.079

00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:18.960
Do you want fish cakes?

00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:27.480
I will go to Shiqiao
to buy you fish cakes today.

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:30.119
Remember to hide the fish cakes well.

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:31.639
Keep them all for yourself.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.760
Got it?

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.000
Stop dawdling. We're late.

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:37.079

she disappeared.

I used to blame her in my heart.

00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:08.800
Why couldn't she have waited longer?

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.119
Now, I realize
she must have encountered trouble.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.800
it was Ye Yibo?

Ye Yibo must have seen
my mom before she left.

He stole the money my mom took.

No.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.599
It might not have been taken by my mom.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.000
Ye Yibo told people

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.039
my mom stole the money

00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:26.960
and left with a man.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.000

00:40:31.239 --> 00:40:32.280
Don't worry.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.280
I'll go

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:37.280
confront him.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.800
He won't admit it.

00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:41.440
We have no evidence.

00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:47.920
Did you look for your mom?

00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:49.960
I did.

00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:51.800
Whenever possible,

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.440
I'd ask about her whereabouts.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.360
But nobody knows anything.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.680
It's okay.

00:41:04.519 --> 00:41:05.800
Wherever your mom went,

00:41:06.199 --> 00:41:08.440
it's better than staying with Ye Yibo.

When you get into college,

00:41:11.599 --> 00:41:13.000
we'll search together.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.000
When we find her,

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:16.880
the truth will come out.

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:19.239
If that money

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.079
was indeed taken by Ye Yibo,

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:22.320
we'll report him

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.519
to clear your mom's name.

The Lingda Corporation.

00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:57.960
They bought the land for redevelopment.

I only have

He's just an employee.

He's probably no help.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.760
Then find out more.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.719
I'll try, but don't get your hopes up.

00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:12.800

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.280
We must tell them everything

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.679
before the mailbox is gone.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.079
If they know in advance,

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:40.559
none of this will happen.

00:42:43.399 --> 00:42:44.920
What are you doing? Pack your stuff!

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.760
No time left.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.840
Hurry up and pack.

00:43:14.519 --> 00:43:15.599
Come on, pack your bag.

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:16.559
Waiting downstairs.

00:43:24.352 --> 00:43:27.936
(Waterspout Airport)

00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:33.039
Got your ID on you?

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:38.439
Hello?

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:41.399
They found my dad.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.280
Bed 63.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.440
The investigation

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.039
has temporarily ruled him out.

00:43:47.039 --> 00:43:48.000
You can go see him now.

00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:50.000
Where did you find him?

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.880
How's he now?

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.800
Is he injured?

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.840
Initially,

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.280
we got a report from a cemetery.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.840
An old man had been staying there,

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.760
refusing to leave.

00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:58.000
When we arrived,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.159
his condition was critical.

00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:00.760
We rushed him to the ER for rescue.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.840
Why rescue?

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.760
What happened to him?

00:44:03.199 --> 00:44:04.039
Don't worry.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.400
He's conscious now.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.599
Why didn't they report earlier?

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.559
They said he visited
every year around this time,

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:13.079
but this year, for some reason,

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:13.960
he refused to leave.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.960
No persuasion worked.

00:44:15.159 --> 00:44:15.999
It's okay.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.320
Dad, it's fine now.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.199
I'm here.

00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:19.880
There's much I want to tell you.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.360
It's all over now.

00:44:21.719 --> 00:44:22.639
It's alright.

00:44:24.239 --> 00:44:25.239
Where's Bed 63?

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.480
What happened?

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.360
I left briefly for medication,
and he vanished.
