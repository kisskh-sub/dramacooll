WEBVTT

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.170
I'll side with you...

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.880
and get you everything. In return,

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.910
on the day you become chairman,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.890
you will make me CEO.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.950
No matter what it takes,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.890
- are you sure you can make me chairman?
- Of course.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.890
To do that,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.030
you can't keep the chairman at home.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.870
If I don't keep him at home?

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.200
Send him to a nursing home.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.310
That's the only way you'll have a reason
to kick Lucia out of the house.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.110
If the chairman stays at home,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.780
that woman will use taking care of him
as an excuse to stick around.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.580
That's true.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.220
Why didn't I think of that?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.180
The house was in an uproar today
because of the chairman.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.250
What are we going to do?
He's only going to get worse.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.050
Don't worry.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.320
I have a plan.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.790
Do you have something in mind?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.490
My father...

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130
I'm sending him to a nursing home.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.760
What?

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.560
A nursing home?

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.470
But that seems a little extreme.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.570
Manager Gong,
you said you were on my side.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.910
I asked if you were on my side or his,
and that's what you said.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.180
- Was that just an empty promise?
- Of course not.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.250
I'm loyal to you.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.110
Then it's settled.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.750
If he passes away there,
it'll be a blessing for both him and us.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.360
So just bear with it a little longer,
Manager Gong.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.590
Once I become the chairman...

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.230
and get that woman, Lucia,
out of this house,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.060
we'll have our perfect happy ending.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.670
If we just get that woman
out of the house,

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.900
Ms. Se Ri will get along with you again,
just like before, right?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.340
She has to.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.940
I like the sound of a "happy ending."

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.250
I shouldn't be laughing,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.750
but why do I keep laughing?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.680
Please stop laughing.
Someone might hear you.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.380
Sorry.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.850
You're drunk. Hurry and get ready for bed.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.120
Manager Gong.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.890
You have no idea how anxious I've been.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.260
I was so afraid that woman
would take Se Ri away from me.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.130
I know. Of course I do.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.070
If I don't, who does?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.370
Watching her call that woman "Mom"
and follow her when they're not related...

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.280
has been tearing me apart.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.460
Now, I'm going to kick that woman out.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.020
I'm going to tell Se Ri everything.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.560
That I'm not her big sister...

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.700
but her real mother,
who gave birth to her.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.770
The chairman is acting that way
because of his dementia,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.610
but what is there to laugh about?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.110
Min Kyung Chae, what are you plotting?

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.890
Whatever you're plotting,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.420
just know that your daughter is
in my hands.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.910
Ji Seop, come to my room for a minute.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.480
I need to talk to you about Dad.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.480
What now?

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.920
What's going on?
Why are you leaving again?

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.690
Director Min is looking for me.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.160
A family matter?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660
It seems like it.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.040
What about Father?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.940
Are you just going to stand by
and do nothing?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.970
What are you talking about?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.640
Kyung Chae already has the doctor's report
for Dad's dementia.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.410
Doesn't it seem strange
she's keeping it so quiet?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.520
She said it's because of
the company's image and the stock price.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.620
She may be a piece of work,
but she cares deeply about the company.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.860
After all she's put you through,
you still don't understand her?

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.060
She's definitely planning something
involving Dad.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.500
What could she possibly do
with a confused old man?

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.360
I met with Lawyer Kim to sound him out,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.630
but he wouldn't tell me
what they're plotting.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.640
Then again, it's not like he'd ever talk.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.940
You need to look into it quietly.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.080
They're definitely up to something.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.910
I'm telling you, my gut is never wrong!

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.750
Any updates on the nursing home situation?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.020
As requested, I'm looking for a facility
where once you're in, you can't get out.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.160
One that's willing to do illegal things,
of course.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.930
I'm counting on you for the nursing home,
Lawyer Kim.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.000
But the rest of your family
is the problem.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.100
Ji Seop is one thing,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.170
but I doubt the Director Min Soo Jung
will agree. Her motives are too obvious.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.440
That's why it has to be a secret.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.910
We have to take care of it
without anyone knowing.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.410
Understood.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.940
By the way, how is the chairman doing?

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.280
I'd like to see for myself.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880
You?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.320
Yes.
I need to see him in person to be sure.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.060
That's the only way I can map out
the specifics...

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.290
of when and how to execute our plan.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.130
Our plan?

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.530
Yes.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.060
Our plan.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.840
So if Chairman Min Doo Sik
really has dementia,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.180
that would mean he doesn't even remember
the secret ledger I've been managing.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.260
Did you find a nursing home?

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.460
Make sure it's a top-of-the-line facility.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.900
Once the chairman goes in there,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.730
he'll never see the light of day again.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.340
What? A nursing home?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.480
She's going to shove Dad
into a nursing home,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.810
just like she did with Mother?

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.920
I was a little surprised at first,

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.350
but the more I think about it,
it actually seems like a good idea.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.790
If Dad stays home,
he'll just keep causing trouble.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.090
With dementia, a patient's condition
only gets worse. It never gets better.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.560
That's just an excuse.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.130
For the patient, being in a facility
is better than being neglected at home.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.740
- That's just the official reason.
- Then what? What's the real issue?

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.070
If Dad goes into a nursing home,
the chairman's seat will be up for grabs.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.980
- So who do you think will take his place?
- Don't tell me Kyung Chae is...

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.350
doing this for Dad's sake
but because she wants the chairman's seat?

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.750
That's why we have to stop her,
no matter what.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.160
If Kyung Chae becomes the chairwoman,
you know what'll happen to us, right?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.730
We have to watch Dad
so she can't sneak him away.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.890
Well, that's what Lucia is there for.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.930
That woman's no fool.
She'll see what's happening.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.530
I was already planning to tell her
to keep a close eye on Dad.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.440
Man, this is a real circus.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.170
One minute you and Kyung Chae team up
to raise hell and kick her out,

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.180
and the next, you team up with Lucia
to stop Kyung Chae.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.020
Welcome.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.090
I heard the chairman was unwell,
so I came to pay him a visit.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.190
I got a call from the CEO.
She said you would be coming.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.490
And the chairman?

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.490
He's in his bedroom with Madam Jung.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.640
It's good to see you eating so well.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.380
Here you go.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.650
What brings you here?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.260
When I heard the chairman was bedridden,
I couldn't possibly stay away.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.530
May I have some water?

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.760
I'm parched from rushing over here.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.130
If you would,

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.800
Madam Jung.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.770
Is it true?
Have you really lost your mind?

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.840
Do you really not remember anything
at all?

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.310
Then you wouldn't remember
what an amazing man you were,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.050
or how successful and powerful you were.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.260
You wouldn't remember
how much I respected you,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.220
or how much I wanted to be just like you.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.430
You wouldn't know that either, would you?

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.270
To me, you were a role model, a mentor,

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.700
and the Almighty.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.840
If I could, I would've even sold my soul
to the devil,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.970
if it meant I could be just like you.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.780
Wanting to marry your eldest daughter
and become part of the owner family...

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.520
was all so I could be your son-in-law
and your trusted right-hand man.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.020
But what is this pathetic display?
You've shattered all my dreams.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:52.990
Reduced to doing this,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.330
having to spoon-feed you of all people.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.500
The era of Min Kyung Chae
is about to begin.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.300
She'll take over Mingang Distribution
and reign supreme.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.170
And I'll be right there by her side.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.270
So...

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.040
While you're still lucid,
you should take the easy way out.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.150
That's the only way to escape
the tragic fate that awaits you.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.520
You've seen the chairman. You can go now.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.190
Fine.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.990
You must have your hands full.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.530
You're really playing the part,
aren't you?

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.070
Are you all right, Chairman?

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.220
If Min Doo Sik is declared incompetent,
his three kids will start an all-out war.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.920
I'm sure they will.
But they all have their own agendas,

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.930
so it'll be hard for them
to make a reckless move.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.360
Exactly.
Every one of those children is dying...

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.700
to take over Mingang Distribution.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.370
Madam.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.900
In my opinion, if we're talking about
CEO Min Kyung Chae,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.810
I suspect she'll be the one to kick
Chairman Min Doo Sik out of the house.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.340
What makes you think that?

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.180
Because right now,
Min Kyung Chae has two main goals.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.920
Becoming chairman and getting rid of Lucia
as soon as possible.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:30.150
So if she gets rid of Min Doo Sik,
Lucia will be dealt with too. Is that it?

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.390
Exactly.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.990
It's just speculation on my part,
of course.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.690
That makes sense.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.430
Now that her own father has dementia,
she must think this is her golden chance.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.570
A chance to get rid of two thorns,
take the chairman's seat and the company.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.640
Of course she'd think of that.
Why wouldn't she?

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.010
And I'm sure right there beside her,

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.910
Kim Sun Jae is the one
whispering in her ear.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.680
So Kim Sun Jae will probably be the one
looking for a home for Min Doo Sik, right?

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.150
Director Min's healthy mom ended up
in a nursing home just like that.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.950
So getting rid of Chairman Min Doo Sik
would be a piece of cake for him.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.360
That Min Kyung Chae
is really something else.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.130
Weren't you stopping by the hospital?

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.300
Oh, yes. I felt
I should check the results...

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.230
of Chairman Min Doo Sik's diagnosis
for myself.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.870
It's true the chairman was an outpatient.
Under his primary physician, Doctor Kim,

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.070
we can confirm he had a brain scan
and was tested for dementia, but...

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.140
But?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.610
The strange thing is,
I saw the scan myself.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.050
Well, it looked pretty typical for someone
who's had brain surgery.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.150
I didn't see anything seriously wrong
with it.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.960
So you're saying you didn't see
any major abnormalities?

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.560
Well, I'm no Doctor Kim,
and this is just my personal opinion.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.500
To say he has dementia based on that
seems like a bit of a stretch.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.240
But then why would his personal physician
diagnose him with dementia?

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.540
I couldn't say.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.810
I really couldn't say.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.250
I told you to just stay here.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.250
This isn't some happy occasion, so why go?

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.520
That's exactly why I have to go.
You've never visited a sick person before?

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.090
Our in-law is in that condition.
If we, his in-laws, just abandon him,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.660
imagine how hurt he would feel.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.960
Just stay here. It's no ordinary sickness.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.230
Ja Kyung said he doesn't recognize anyone.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.770
He has to be spoon-fed like a toddler,

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.200
and he might even soil himself. If you go,
it'll just be embarrassing for you both.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.970
I'll clean up after him. If he's confused,
I'll be confused right there with him.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.310
So what if it's awkward? I don't mind.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.680
Goodness, just drop it, you old coot!

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.120
What? An old coot?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.250
You beautiful old crone,
you've got quite a mouth on you.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.550
"Old crone," is it?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.790
You listen to me, you hear?

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.190
When I say don't do something
as a boss, you don't do it.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.000
Gosh, look at your eyes.
What did you just say? "Boss?"

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.630
As in, "Sister?"

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.770
I mean, let's be honest.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.500
It's a fact that Yang Mal Sook
is two years older than Oh Pan Sool.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.410
What in the world kind of nonsense
are you talking about now?

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.240
I don't care if you're
2 or 20 years older.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.140
The husband is the king of the castle!

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.680
You're going to make your eyes pop out.
I'm too busy now, so I'm leaving,

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.990
but we'll pick this up
when I see you again. Darn you.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.090
For goodness' sake! I told you not to go.
Ja Kyung told you to stay away.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.790
Let go! Let go of me!

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.360
No, I won't! I'll never let you go!
You're not going anywhere!

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.700
What is this, a soap opera?
Are we auditioning for a melodrama?

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.630
- Let go of me!
- Gosh!

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.440
- My pants are falling off! Let go!
- My goodness!

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.140
What are you doing in broad daylight?
Trying to make a sibling for Ja Kyung?

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.580
Fine, let's do it! Take it all off!
You take your clothes off too!

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.750
So you were planning to send Dad
to a nursing home all along.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.350
Don't even think about playing dumb.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.990
I already know everything.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.860
You're dumping Dad in a nursing home,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.990
so you can take over as chairman.
Did you think no one would figure it out?

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.300
Since you seem to know everything,

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.370
don't try to stop me.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.870
- Because this is all for Father.
- For Dad?

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.970
That's a laugh.
Why don't you try being honest for once?

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.880
You only ever think about yourself,
don't you?

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.550
We can just leave for the office,

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.150
but what about the family at home
with him?

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.780
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to care for a patient with dementia?

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.990
Since when do you care so much
about the family?

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.990
If you won't be Father's hands and feet,
then keep your mouth shut.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.760
That's what Lucia is for.

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.790
And how long do you think
Lucia will stick around?

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.260
Playing the part of a caregiver with
no inheritance or shares on the line.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.500
How long do you really think she'll last?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.340
Well...

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.370
Are you going to let Dad, just like Mom,

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.880
die in a nursing home?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.280
- If that's Father's destiny, so be it.
- Kyung Chae!

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.380
Don't waste your energy.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.280
Nothing you do will change the outcome.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.560
So, is it true? Is Kyung Chae
really sending your father to a home?

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.460
Oh, that's great.
That's the best news I've heard all day.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.670
I knew Kyung Chae had it in her.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.270
You don't know anything, so just be quiet.
It's not that simple.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.840
Then what's the problem?

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.980
Do you want me to waste my life on him
until I'm old and gray?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.610
When did I ever say that?

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.980
Anyway, we can talk about this again
at home.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.790
No, stop talking.
Just do whatever Kyung Chae says.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.060
Come out and watch the chairman for a bit.
I need to step out.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.430
- Again?
- I'm getting herbs for his dementia.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.370
Would you rather go?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.740
Who, me? I never said that.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.180
Gosh.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.910
Chairman, I'll be right back.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.120
Keep a close eye on the chairman.
And don't take your eyes off him.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.470
Father, you see,

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.780
it feels a little wrong to say this now,

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.350
but I'm going to say it anyway.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.380
Now that you're in this condition,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.420
I'm honestly not scared of you anymore.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:43.290
You know how you opposed our marriage
because my father was a loan shark?

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.630
I was absolutely furious back then.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.930
I secretly cursed you out and everything.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.940
I even wished you'd get old
and end up with dementia.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.640
But I never thought it would come true
so soon.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.840
I had no idea.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.410
So you mean there's a chance his symptoms
aren't real.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:33.380
That's what Moon Tae Kyung said.
The nurse told him the case was unusual.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.610
So he's faking dementia
when he doesn't even have it?

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.620
Who knows?
It's not like we can read his mind.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.620
Unbelievable.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.950
So what's the truth?

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.560
That's what you're here to find out.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.660
Just in case,
you're careful around Min Doo Sik, right?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.200
Of course.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.030
Kim Sun Jae stopped by the house.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.770
I was worried he'd say something weird
in front of Chairman Min.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.480
Why would that jerk go there?
He's always so annoyingly diligent.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.560
Oh, my.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.330
What do you think you're doing?

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.200
It's fun.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.300
How could you do this to the chairman?

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.740
He's out of it anyway.
What's the big deal?

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.750
Honestly, ma'am.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.950
Playing games like a little kid.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.190
Well, days like these are numbered.
Once Father goes to the nursing home...

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.990
What?

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.460
Looks like you already know.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.160
Ma'am, how did you know?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.870
My husband told me, of course.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.670
Apparently, Kyung Chae is the one
planning to send him to a nursing home.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.210
That's great.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.280
Manager Gong, you should get everything
off your chest about him.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.380
Once he's in there,
who knows when you'll see him again?

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.320
Why would I have any complaints?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.720
Oh, of course you do.
Come on, just let it all out.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.430
I'm telling you, when I did it earlier,
it felt like a ten-year burden was lifted.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.600
- Really?
- I'm telling you.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.040
If you bottle it up, you'll get sick.
Go on.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.080
Chairman.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.250
Last time,
when there was that issue with Madam Jung,

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.420
you ignored me and took her side.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.090
And you told me to get out of the house.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.890
I know you were blinded by her, but still!

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.730
I, Manager Gong...

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.290
I mean, is this what I, Gong Mae Ja,

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.060
get after all these years
I've served this family?

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.530
Oh, my.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.370
Wait, your name is actually Gong Mae Ja?

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.870
Yes, it's Gong Mae Ja.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.410
Did you think I didn't have a name?
I wasn't born "Manager Gong," you know.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.950
I'm not finished yet.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:23.880
Chairman.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.520
You'll be punished for acting this way.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.050
He's getting what he deserves right now.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.360
So? Doesn't that feel great?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.360
- It does.
- See? Feels good, right?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.330
Now that we've cleared the air,
how about some coffee?

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.440
- Oh, my gosh! Chairman!
- Hey, what are you doing?

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.840
- Dad!
- Chairman!

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.640
Dad! Stop it!

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.910
I'm sorry!

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080
Wait, hold on!

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.510
Dad! Stop it!

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.580
Chairman!

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.490
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.790
Honey, look at this.
I'm telling you, a whole clump fell out.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.690
Honey, just send him to a home.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.630
I told you it's not that simple.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.600
What do you mean, it's not?
What are you hesitating for?

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.740
It's complicated.
If Father goes into a home,

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.640
- things at the company will get messy.
- Seriously.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.290
Pull it out. Right here.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.090
I think I got it.
Gosh, what are we going to do?

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.960
Ji Seop, come out here.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.590
- Why?
- We have to tell Kyung Chae, don't we?

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.230
So you're just going to let him get sent
to a nursing home,

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:50.470
- and watch Kyung Chae become Chairwoman?
- What?

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.840
Gosh, that's out of the question.
Hey, follow me.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.510
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.180
We're against it.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.120
You are not sending Dad to a nursing home.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.350
So, you're going to defy me
to the very end.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.020
Are you going to be the one
to take care of him?

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.560
Have you ever spent even one day
by his side?

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.990
Stop pretending to care about this family.
It's disgusting, and I can't stand it.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.460
What?

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.000
Disgusting?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.570
Sending Dad away,
and kicking Lucia out of the house,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.870
team up with Lawyer Kim
to take over as chairman,

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.740
and swallow up Mingang Distribution!

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.510
And eventually, you'll get rid of
Ji Seop and me too, right?

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.210
Am I wrong?

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.380
I'll say it again.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.120
We are against it.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.190
We are not sending Dad to a nursing home.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.620
Try and do it on your own
if you think you can.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.790
We'll call the police on you right away.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.150
Something's definitely up
with that Min Doo Sik.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.820
The truth will come out later,

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.780
but something smells fishy.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.910
Se Ri, why are you still up?

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.580
I think Kyung Chae plans on putting Dad
in a nursing home.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.820
Who told you that?

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.750
Manager Gong and Ja Kyung said so earlier.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.490
It's already shocking enough
that Dad has dementia,

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.690
but for Kyung Chae to act like this
is even more outrageous.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.360
Don't worry.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.030
I won't let that happen.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.370
Now you see why I told you
not to get close to Kyung Chae, right?

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.880
Good. From now on,
just stay away from Kyung Chae.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.080
So Ji Seop and Director Min
are dead set against it.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.520
How on earth did they find out?
Since when have they cared about Father?

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.860
I expected Director Min to oppose it,
but I didn't expect it from Ji Seop.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.090
If Soo Jung gets in his ear,
Ji Seop will fall for it completely.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.800
You know what my brother is like.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.730
It would've been better
if they didn't know, but what can you do?

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.470
It doesn't matter.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.600
They'd find out anyway once the chairman
is confined to the nursing home,

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.010
- so let's just say they found out early.
- We have no other choice now.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.880
We just have to act
as quickly as possible.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.580
So it seems Min Kyung Chae is dead set
on shoving her father into a nursing home.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.480
We absolutely can't let that happen.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.390
You need to stick close to Min Doo Sik.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.560
We can't give her an opening.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.100
It's time for you to make the call.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.230
I'll handle the Director Min.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:09.670
You will?

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:13.440
Actually, she called me in right after
the chairman was diagnosed with dementia.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.070
She told me to abandon you
and join her side.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.980
I'll ensure Director Min
doesn't get in your way.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.250
You just walk your own path.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.050
Stash the chairman somewhere
no one can find him,

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.290
then immediately call a board meeting...

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.190
and switch to an Acting Chairman system.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.990
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:26.380
Put him where no one can see him
and don't discharge him without my word.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.280
A closed-off place you can only leave
in a coffin.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.850
Don't worry.
No one will take him by force on my watch.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.790
Why don't you try
to get your father's will...

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.020
completely changed?

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.920
Who's requesting what? Moon Tae Kyung.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.690
What do you really think you can do to me?

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.660
I checked the chairman's medical chart,
and I found something strange.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.760
Strange in what way?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.400
