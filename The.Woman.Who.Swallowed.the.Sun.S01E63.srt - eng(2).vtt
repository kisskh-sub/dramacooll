00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.740
CEO Han Kyung Soo of Doeun Industries.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.550
A while back, the man told me
he needed funds for his business,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.110
so he came looking for me.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.050
The collateral he put up at the time...

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.850
(Episode 63)

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.050
is this.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.520
Not long after he put this up
and borrowed my hard-earned money,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.290
CEO Han and his wife died
in a mysterious accident,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.560
on the very same day,
at the very same time. So I heard.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.130
But strangely enough, at some point,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.130
this new technology ended up with Mingang.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.240
Doesn't that strike you as a bit fishy?

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.970
The original owner is dead,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.710
and the totally unrelated Chairman Min
gets his hands on the new technology,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.810
and then Doeun Industries
gets taken over by Mingang.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.120
Are you using this to blackmail me?

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.650
Blackmail?

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.790
Why would I do such a thing?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.460
We're practically family.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.860
Our children are married to each other.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.240
Go on, tear it up.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.810
Rip it! Rip it to shreds!

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.740
Rip it to shreds!
That'll solve everything, won't it?

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.910
If that were the original, yes.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.120
But what a shame, it's just a copy.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.780
Chairman Min.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.690
Think about it carefully.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.320
It's not that big of an ask, is it? Right?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.560
Well?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.630
Give me a call soon.
But be warned, I'm an impatient man.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.400
Darn it all, I can't wait for long.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.140
I'll be on my way.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.880
Mingang lifts me higher

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.750
Darn it!

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.560
Mingang is becoming
ever more precious to me.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.970
He's held on to this all this time?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.570
Now that Jo Pil Doo has been dealt with,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.270
I thought this would never see the light
of day again.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.380
That son of a...

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.250
If Oh Pan Sool really has the original,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.990
he might not do it now,
but one day he could expose everything.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.190
Darn it!

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.490
That despicable snake!

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.590
This is unbelievable!

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.460
About what you said last time,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.700
I was wondering
if you had any grounds for it.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.230
For you to say something like that to me,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.070
I figured you weren't
just saying it to say it.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.100
I'm just saying
it never hurts to be careful.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.310
Someone who manages
a company's slush fund,

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.380
skimming money behind the owner's back...

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.510
It happens quite often in other companies.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.550
So you're just speaking in general terms,
and not saying Lawyer Kim actually did it?

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.780
But you want me to be suspicious of him?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.290
That is for you to decide, Ms. Min.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.860
It seems you're trying to drive a wedge
between me and Lawyer Kim.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.460
Please don't misunderstand.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.230
I have no reason to try
and drive you two apart.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.470
But given that Lawyer Kim...

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.000
is one of the owner's family's
closest confidants,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.170
I'm just saying this
out of an abundance of caution.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.380
I subtly planted the seed with Ms. Min,
but I'm not sure if it'll go our way.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.580
Well, that's to be expected.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.720
But when a man with your reputation
says something like that,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.160
no one can just brush it off.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.560
Especially Min Kyung Chae.
If there's one thing she knows,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.160
it's that you're a straight-arrow
who always does things by the book.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.730
Min Kyung Chae knows that better
than anyone.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.570
So now we just wait for them to start
suspecting and distrusting each other,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.710
and for the day they turn their backs
on one another?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.680
That's the plan. Oh, and one more thing.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.750
Your parents' contract,
the one Oh Pan Sool has in his safe,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.380
you have to get your hands on it.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.120
Now that the only witness is gone,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.760
- shouldn't you at least get the evidence?
- Wait, how do you know about that?

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.200
Lucia mentioned it once.
Anyway, I'll take care of it,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.230
so don't you worry about it.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.700
What did you need to see me about?

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.770
Lawyer Kim, you're not going
behind my back and the chairman's...

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.240
to line your own pockets, are you?

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.380
- What is this all of a sudden?
- I was just wondering.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.510
For managers of a company's slush funds,
that sort of thing is common, isn't it?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.350
On the surface,
they earn the family's trust,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.190
but behind their backs,
they're feathering their own nest...

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.520
and end up stabbing
their masters in the back.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.060
How can you not trust me?

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.460
After all my years dedicated to Mingang?

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.030
Time served doesn't always mean loyalty.
Especially for someone like you.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.830
And what kind of person do you think I am?

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.770
I know very well what you've been after
all this time at our company.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.870
You wanted to ride the owner's coattails,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.780
and you needed me to do it.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.950
To Kim Sun Jae, Min Kyung Chae was just
his ticket to the top,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.090
nothing more, nothing less. Right?

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.090
I'm truly disappointed.
After everything I've done for you.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.900
You really can't tell that my feelings
for you are genuine?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.130
Besides, when it's for you, I don't care
if it's illegal or just bending the rules.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.430
Whatever you needed,
I went above and beyond to get it done.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.970
And wasn't that just
to serve your own agenda?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.210
Who is it, then?

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.540
Who on earth has been slandering me?

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.440
Who would try to drive a wedge between us?

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.180
Moon Tae Kyung?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.010
You! What did you say to Ms. Min
to make her act like this?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.510
What do you think you're doing?

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.880
Do you take me for a fool, Lawyer Kim?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.590
How dare you barge into my office
and cause a scene?

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.620
Ms. Min wouldn't suddenly suspect me
unless you were involved.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.960
- Maybe you did something to deserve it.
- What did you say?

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.560
If you had nothing to hide,
you wouldn't be getting so worked up.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.530
If you're so upset about being suspected,
then prove your innocence.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.800
Ms. Min only trusts clear proof.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.540
That ledger you're in charge of...

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.470
Wouldn't this all be cleared up
if you just showed her the secret ledger?

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.480
If you even mention that secret ledger
to sway Ms. Min one more time,

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.580
- I won't let you get away with it.
- Why is that?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.420
Did you really cook the books
behind the Chairman's back?

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.150
Do you have any proof
that I cooked the books?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.560
If you're being framed, like you claim,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.730
then shouldn't the one crying foul
be the one to prove their innocence?

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.910
Only he can nullify the stock waiver,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.380
and Chairman Min would never nullify it
without a compelling reason.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.830
- Yes, it's me.
- Has Min Doo Sik arrived yet?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.830
- Not yet.
- Even I think it's impossible for you...

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.700
to nullify the waiver of stock
rights on your own.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.370
A surer bet would be
to secure more shares in Mingang.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.040
Even if we pool all of our shares,
it won't be enough, right?

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.540
Even with that girl Se Ri's shares,
it's not even close.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.410
This isn't nearly enough
to shake up Mingang.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.610
To make Chairman Min give me his shares,
we have to disrupt the line of succession.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.080
Exactly.
Not to his children, but to you, Lucia.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.750
We have to create a situation
where he's forced to hand over his shares.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.890
Those siblings are already
at each other's throats,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.790
so what if we set the stage
and pit them against one another?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.300
To do that,
we first need to look at the share ratios.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.210
Stop right there.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.280
(All recordings)

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.160
(One selected)

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.760
(Move this recording to trash?)

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.730
Eavesdropping, spying,
and now you're recording me.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.000
What is the meaning of this?

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.910
Seriously?

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.310
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.380
You need to be more discerning
about which orders you follow.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.890
If you're the boss, then act like one.
Don't make your people do your dirty work.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840
Hey.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.610
What is going on here?

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.180
Dad should know about this, right?

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.050
Of course he does.
He needs to know that woman's true colors.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.990
When Father gets home,
I'm telling him everything.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.460
Didn't you hear?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.290
Kyung Chae apparently made
Manager Gong do something bad.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.560
That's why she can't say a peep.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.430
She knows if you tell Dad, it'll get ugly,
so she's keeping her mouth shut.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.170
What were you thinking, getting caught?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.170
I didn't expect her to come out
of the room so suddenly.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.640
I told you to be careful!
Haven't you learned from last time?

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:06.880
I'm sorry.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.050
Fine. Who was she on the phone with?

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.250
I'm not sure who it was,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.560
but given how secretive she was,
it couldn't have been good news.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.930
What happened to your face?
Did someone hit you?

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.270
- Of course not.
- But it's swollen from being hit.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.210
Who was it?

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.680
Who in this house
would do something like that?

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.610
Especially to the person
who works the hardest for our family.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.550
Se Ri was hungry, so I fed her first.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.820
I've been worried about her at mealtimes.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.950
Please, take Se Ri's seat.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.660
No, I'm fine.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.400
Come on.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.370
Go on, have a seat!

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.880
You're getting the royal treatment.
The lady of the house is fussing over you.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.850
You've really hit the jackpot.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.520
Don't just dote on Manager Gong.
I could use some attention too.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.420
But I only want to fuss over Manager Gong.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.470
Gosh, that woman...

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.970
She gives me chills
with that innocent face. Absolute chills!

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.440
Honey, she's scaring me.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.210
At least with Kyung Chae,
you can tell she's a jerk.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.550
That rude brat.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.780
Exactly. So you be careful, too.
Especially when I'm not around.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.050
I don't get it!

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.450
What in the world does Doo Sik see in her?

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.960
You know what I'm afraid of?
That she'll suddenly have Dad's baby.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.590
Come on, that's ridiculous!
Think about how old Doo Sik is.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.170
Don't be so naive!
They say a man can still father a child.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.540
- You're so naive.
- But we don't even have a kid yet.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.010
If Doo Sik beats us to it,
that would really be crossing a line.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.080
I drink it for my health,
but it just makes me incredibly sleepy.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.610
That's normal at first.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.320
It takes time for your body to adjust.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.250
It has all-around benefits,
so you must take it consistently.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.520
Of course. I wouldn't recommend
something bad for you, would I?

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.790
I suppose that's true.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.860
But is there something on your mind?

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.000
Of course not.
Not when I have you by my side.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.870
Oh, come on now.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.070
Do you want your job back at the company?

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.010
Yes, of course!

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.780
Father, I've been waiting for you to call.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.020
Then go to your father-in-law tomorrow.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.720
Tell him he'll be
a non-executive director at Mingang.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.250
Come to think of it,

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.990
he has invested so much
in our company, after all.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.620
Why all of a sudden?

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.160
I mean, my father-in-law
will be thrilled, but...

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.860
But there's a condition.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.660
A condition?

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.870
Go to your in-laws
and find something out for me.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.470
Find out what?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.940
So, your father is going to make me
a non-executive director,

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.680
and he promised to give you your job back?
Is that it?

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.010
Yes, exactly. Come on, you know him.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.410
My father isn't a man who goes back
on his word.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.980
He told me I could start
as early as tomorrow.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.020
Oh, that's wonderful!
Chairman Min really is something else.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.960
Things get done in a flash
with just one word from him.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.760
Go to your father-in-law.
Just find out where he keeps...

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.800
the collateral for his loans.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.130
But, Father-in-law?
Could I ask you something?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.400
Of course. Ask away.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.940
Father-in-law, from people you lend to,
you take collateral, don't you?

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.370
Does he just take it?

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:00.610
He won't do business without collateral.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.010
So what are you getting at?

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.620
Land deeds, contracts,
all sorts of documents.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.120
I understand you take anything of value.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.890
So what? Why are you dragging this out?

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.530
Just spit it out.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.990
And you, go get dinner ready.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.060
It's always, "Dinner, dinner, dinner."

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.460
Of course we eat every day.
What, do you think we eat once a month?

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.000
Right. So what's your point?

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.700
- Well, it's just that...
- Hold on.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.310
Hey, fishy boy! What is it now?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.410
What? Fishing? For mandarin fish?

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.580
Why would I go fishing for you? You goof!

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.890
Mother-in-law.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520
Wow!

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.790
Man, that looks incredible.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.430
So, do you know
where Father-in-law's secret safe is?

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.130
His secret safe?

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:54.530
Why do you ask?

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.700
Why? No reason.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.840
Just curious about collateral.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.370
There's a picture frame in that room.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.240
Take it down, and you'll find a safe.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.280
All the collateral is in there too.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.510
He even had a security camera installed.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.910
I see.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.220
Here, try this.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.650
How is it?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.130
There's a picture frame in the small room,

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.500
and she said the safe is behind it.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.400
She said the collateral is in the safe.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.770
But she said there's a security camera
in the room.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.810
Father,
does this mean I can come back to work?

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.280
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.340
Go ahead.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.220
Well, well. If it isn't Lawyer Kim.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.690
What are you doing here?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.990
To see the chairman.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.700
He told me I can have my job back.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.830
How nice to be part of the "royal family."
You get your job back just like that.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.170
So, what's she like at home?

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.070
Who? Lucia?

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.810
Don't even get me started.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.580
Even talking about her leaves a bad taste.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.150
Is it that bad?

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.720
Anything new with you lately?

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.690
You know, come to think of it,
Kyung Chae hasn't mentioned you lately.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.990
It's because someone keeps making
Kyung Chae suspicious of me.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.130
Kyung Chae is suspicious of you?
Because of who?

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.630
Someone keeps trying to drive
a wedge between us.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.330
Who?

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.270
A real snake in the grass.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.740
I've felt conflicted ever since we spoke,
Director Moon.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.840
Half of me thinks
Lawyer Kim would never do that,

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.040
and the other half thinks maybe he would.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.510
It's not because of me, ma'am.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.450
You've always felt that way, deep down.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.220
I suppose you're right.
It's always been that way with Lawyer Kim.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.220
I could never trust him completely,

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.490
but I could never completely
distrust him either.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.260
It was always like that.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.730
The truth is, you needed Lawyer Kim
for what you're trying to accomplish,

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:06.760
and for his own ambitions,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.500
he needed you.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.200
That's what makes it so difficult.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.600
A relationship of mutual convenience.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.140
Then instead of a relationship like that,

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.540
why don't you try putting
your trust in me?

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:21.010
With what, exactly?

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.820
Lawyer Kim manages the family's cash flow.
I can find out if he's doing it properly.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.620
I'll track the flow of money for you.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.050
All of a sudden?

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.220
Why would you do that, Director Moon?

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.890
Because I also want to be...

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:37.730
someone you need.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.500
Se Ri, where are you off to?

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.110
I'm going to meet a friend.
I'll be back soon.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.880
You don't have to rush back.
It's been a while, so go enjoy yourself.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.980
Why come home so early?

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.580
You really get me.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.620
Do you need some spending money?

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:02.650
I'm good, I have plenty.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.890
- I'm heading out.
- Have a good time.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.540
With my daughter-in-law out as well,
it's just the two of us here.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:21.810
Come, sit for a moment.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.490
You seem incredibly loyal
to the eldest daughter, Manager Gong.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.890
I wouldn't call it loyalty.
I just feel like she's family.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.830
I wish you'd share
some of that warmth with me.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.800
What do you mean by that?

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.070
You've been in this house longer
than anyone else.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.670
You must know everything that goes on
with this family,

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.010
and I think it's time you shared it
with me.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.510
Are you asking me to tell you
the family's secrets?

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.780
And why shouldn't you?

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:03.880
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.580
I noticed the floor upstairs
is quite stained.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.390
Why don't you go mop it?

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360
Me?

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.060
You expect me to do it?

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.300
The housekeeper is coming tomorrow, so...

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.100
And you expect me to put up with
this mess until tomorrow?

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.450
There, it's all done.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.220
You missed a spot.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.370
I've cleaned it all now.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.640
It's still not clean.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.050
- I've really cleaned the whole thing now.
- Keep scrubbing.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.630
What do you think you're doing?

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.400
Pick that rag back up.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.770
No, I'm not going to do that.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.740
I'm not some dog you're training.
How can you make me scrub for this long?

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.440
Because there's a stain on the floor.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.940
That's not why.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.180
You were trying to find dirt
on this family,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.680
and punishing me for my silence.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.450
Well, if you knew this would happen,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.980
you should have just answered me earlier.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.950
Excuse me?

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:51.290
You were cocky because she had your back.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.860
It would've been easier if you answered.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.530
Gosh, just listen to yourself.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.700
My goodness.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.930
I'm the elder lady of this house.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.700
And do you know what that means?

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.340
It means getting rid of someone like you
would be nothing to me.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.970
Are you threatening me?
Are you saying you'll have me thrown out?

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.180
Then, if you don't want to get thrown out,
you'd better learn how to grovel.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.550
Grovel? You have got to be kidding me.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.720
Let me say it again.
I'm the one who can throw you out broke.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.950
- You hear?
- Oh, my word.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.350
Goodness.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.600
Manager Gong,
do you really dislike me this much?

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.200
What? Why the sudden change of attitude?

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.410
Of course I don't like you.
Did you really think I would?

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.670
Then you should have just said so.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.180
Why did you ignore me all day long?

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.810
What are you talking about?
Who's ignoring whom?

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.050
You did.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.450
You called me an outsider
who just showed up...

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.150
and that I wouldn't last long here.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.390
Fine, since we're on the subject!
If you're not an outsider, what are you?

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.090
A woman like you will last
a year or two at most. You hear me?

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.230
No, on second thought.
Our chairman gets bored easily.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.630
- Six months at most?
- What do you think you're doing?

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.970
Is this how you treat her
when I'm not around?

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.440
No, that's not it, Chairman.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.880
- This woman started it.
- How dare you call her "this woman?"

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.110
If I hadn't seen this with my own eyes,
I would've been completely fooled.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:25.720
You're a terrible person.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.720
Get out of my house this instant!

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.190
My goodness, your call was a surprise.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:37.990
What brings you here to see me?

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.830
But Manager Gong,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.000
goodness, how much have you had to drink?

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.740
Yeon Ah,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.810
I'm just so upset. I really am.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.510
Goodness, what happened?

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.510
Tell me all about it. I'm here to listen.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.550
After everything I've done for them,

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.680
how could they do this to me?

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.250
Chairman really went too far,
don't you think?

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.250
How could he tell me to get out?

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.030
- Oh my gosh, the chairman told you to go?
- Yes.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.830
It's just like they say, the outsider
rolls in and pushes the old-timer out.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.870
That's exactly what happened!
Exactly! Right?

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.640
Some sly vixen comes waltzing in
and starts preying on people.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.970
Gosh, darn it.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.040
Well, what choice do people like us have?

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.740
When a new madam comes,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.310
you just adapt and obey.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.580
Hey! Do you think you and I are the same?

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.320
I've been with them for almost 30 years.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.150
Thirty years!

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.420
Filling the void left by our late madam,

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.130
I served our chairman with all my heart.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.700
You know?

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.200
Oh, of course.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.030
You're nothing like a hired hand like me.
Of course you're different. Completely.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.240
Right. Totally different.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.070
But those brats picked the wrong person.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.340
If I were to say just one word,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.480
they'd be done for.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.850
Maybe I should air their dirty laundry.
Darn it.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.120
Oh? What's so disgusting?

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.460
Please. Where would I even start?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.660
Good grief.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.330
For starters,
there's our Ms. Kyung Chae, you know?

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.600
A "perfect, successful single woman?"
Oh, please.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.430
Don't make me laugh. What a joke.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.970
She's nothing but a two-faced backstabber.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.070
And you have young Miss Se Ri
looking high and low for her birth mother,

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.540
and I just had to laugh. I mean, honestly.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.510
Wait, what are you trying to say?

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.520
Darn it, why are you so dense?

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.220
That's my point.
It's right under her nose.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.990
Right under her nose.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.690
Honestly,
why look all over when she's right there?

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.760
You know, when you think about it,

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.460
that Se Ri girl is pretty clueless.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.500
Se Ri is so dumb. A total fool.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.270
- Se Ri's so dumb. She's...
- Manager Gong!

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.070
- Dummy Se Ri.
- Manager Gong!

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.380
Dummy Se Ri...

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.910
Oh my gosh, did I just hear that right?

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.050
Dummy...

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:15.890
Se Ri.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.120
Oh, honey. Who were you drinking with?

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.260
With some friends.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.760
Hurry and get to your room.
You'll be in for it if he finds out.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.730
Stepmother,
I'm in a really good mood today.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:31.840
Oh, you are?

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200
Let's get you inside.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.510
- Gosh.
- Get a grip, Min Se Ri.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.510
Walk straight!

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.470
Here's honey water. Make her drink it.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.400
Now that you've gotten what you wanted,

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.870
you can drop the phony act.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.510
What did you just say?

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.880
I said stop playing mommy
to the kid. It's disgusting.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.890
Just stick to being Father's woman.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.390
I'll take care of Se Ri.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.990
Do you know how much I worried over her,
afraid something would happen to her?

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.530
Would someone like you even know?

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.000
You care so much for your sister.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.000
How do you plan to repay me
for what you did...

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.040
to my precious daughter, Mi So?

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.250
- Hello? It's me.
- Hey, if anyone's around, just listen.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.760
What's going on?

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.060
Well, Manager Gong was here saying things
that were really strange.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.630
I'm talking about her boss,
Min Kyung Chae.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.700
She's never been married, right?

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.900
Well, she said Kyung Chae is actually
Se Ri's mother.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.940
What? What did you say?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.770
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.790
Kyung Chae,
I'm afraid I made a terrible mistake.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.960
Are you willing to trust me with this?

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.960
Just how far can I trust you,
Director Moon?

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.570
Do you now get why I'm helping Lucia?

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.800
As long as I have this,
Mingang is as good as mine.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.510
If you don't want to do time,
you'll do exactly as I say.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.610
We must use Min Doo Sik's last weakness.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.280
It's time we seize it for ourselves.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.220
