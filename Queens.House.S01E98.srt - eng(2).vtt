00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:03.315
Drag all of this trash out of my house.

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.925
And every last one of their belongings too!

00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:09.495
Gi Chan...

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:11.265
No, you can't.

00:00:11.395 --> 00:00:13.125
- Mom! - Mom.

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:15.535
- Mom. - I'm not leaving. I won't go!

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.965
Where am I supposed to go? This is my house.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.205
You want me to call the cops and have you dragged out of here?

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.345
Hello? Is this the police?

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:30.745
A woman is trespassing in my house. Please come arrest her right away.

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:33.945
If I press charges for trespassing, what's the sentence?

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:36.785
Three years in prison?

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.025
The address is Changpyeong-dong...

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:42.325
Shut your mouth!

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:44.495
You...

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.095
Goodness. Oh, no.

00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:49.365
I'm not leaving! I won't go!

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:53.465
I won't go!

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:55.805
I'm not leaving! I won't go!

00:00:55.935 --> 00:00:59.705
Darn it! Darn you all!

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:11.585
Dad.

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:14.595
The house you left for me.

00:01:15.655 --> 00:01:17.155
I've finally gotten it back.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:19.595
I'll never...

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:21.795
I'll never let anyone take it from me again.

00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:37.945
This looks like trash. What should I do with it?

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:43.985
What kind of stain is this?

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:45.855
It looks like blood.

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:48.055
Was this hidden here?

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:02.705
Gi Chan.

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:05.005
Are we really living here now?

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:07.405
Yes.

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.545
They froze our accounts, so I couldn't get any money out.

00:02:11.415 --> 00:02:13.345
This was all I could afford with the cash I had on me.

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.755
I doubt even a quarter of our stuff from Changpyeong-dong will fit.

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:19.455
What are we going to do?

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:21.755
Since the place is too small,

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.755
we won't be able to use most of our furniture or appliances.

00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:26.395
We'll just have to buy what we need secondhand.

00:02:27.695 --> 00:02:28.965
It'll be rough, but just bear with it.

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:31.835
Okay.

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.275
Gi Chan, we're not totally ruined, are we?

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:45.045
For now, just go get us something to eat.

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:47.885
Okay.

00:02:48.985 --> 00:02:50.285
My goodness...

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:56.325
Dear deities...

00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:00.965
How could this have happened to us?

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:04.935
I worked so hard to make that money!

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.505
I worked myself to the bone,

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:11.605
scraping together every last penny!

00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:17.115
Did you report that tramp Se Ri to the cops?

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:19.785
What did I tell you?

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:22.485
Didn't I warn you about the women you meet?

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.755
You brought home some good-for-nothing tramp,

00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:27.825
and now look at this mess! Just look!

00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:40.165
Hello? Detective?

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:43.175
Any updates? Did you catch the con artists?

00:03:45.205 --> 00:03:46.405
No.

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:49.015
There are no security cameras in the office either.

00:03:49.715 --> 00:03:52.545
The part-timer posing as the agent and the buyer's representative.

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:54.485
It's obvious they were all in on it together.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.015
Isn't this a full-blown fraud ring?

00:03:58.725 --> 00:03:59.855
I'll call you back.

00:04:03.525 --> 00:04:05.065
If they were kicked out of the house,

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:06.495
that means con artists took over.

00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:09.295
Why didn't I think of that?

00:04:15.835 --> 00:04:16.835
(Seller: Hwang Ji Ho, Buyer: Kang Jae In)

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:18.445
What's this?

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.875
The buyer's name is Kang Jae In?

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.515
But when I checked the document, it definitely said...

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:29.515
Everything looks fine.

00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:31.785
I checked it all, too.

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:34.925
All right, then. I'll just stamp the rest of the documents.

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:46.135
This ink pad is all dried up.

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:50.575
This one's too faint. I'll get a new pad and re-stamp it.

00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:15.095
There we go.

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:18.305
Here, take the sales contract.

00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:20.535
And now, we can settle up.

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:35.115
Those jerks swapped the contracts on me!

00:05:39.885 --> 00:05:41.055
She's a horrible woman!

00:05:41.895 --> 00:05:44.825
- Gi Man, grab her quickly! - Get her!

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:47.665
- Get her. I got her! - Hey, let me go!

00:05:47.725 --> 00:05:49.165
I got her.

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:53.205
We caught her snooping around and dragged her in here.

00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:55.375
Ji Ho is in the master bedroom, right?

00:05:56.335 --> 00:05:57.675
Go and make sure he stays in there.

00:05:58.105 --> 00:05:59.105
Okay.

00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:05.885
Honey, I can explain everything.

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:07.615
This was all Kang Jae In's doing.

00:06:07.945 --> 00:06:10.415
I sold the house for your sake to a wealthy Chinese person,

00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:12.955
but it turns out that Chinese person was Jae In.

00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:15.955
The check she gave me was fake!

00:06:16.095 --> 00:06:18.895
That tramp totally messed with me! She scammed me!

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:24.705
You sold our house without even talking to me?

00:06:25.665 --> 00:06:26.965
And you expect me to believe you did it for me?

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.435
You were just going to run off with the money, weren't you?

00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:30.975
That's not true, honey.

00:06:31.275 --> 00:06:32.275
It's really not.

00:06:32.745 --> 00:06:35.615
Please, just believe me. I'm not hiding anything anymore.

00:06:35.675 --> 00:06:36.775
You know that.

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:38.915
Nothing?

00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:42.085
Are you telling me there's not one thing you're hiding from me?

00:06:42.115 --> 00:06:44.285
Nothing. I swear!

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:46.855
Ji Ho.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:52.225
Do I have to be the one to say whose son Ji Ho really is?

00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:57.595
You make me sick. I'm so fed up and disgusted by you.

00:06:58.405 --> 00:07:00.235
How could you lie that he was my son?

00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:02.675
If you hadn't told me he was mine...

00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:06.175
If I hadn't, you would've left me!

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:08.375
You'd have never left Kang Jae In.

00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:10.715
Is that what this is about?

00:07:15.855 --> 00:07:16.855
That's right.

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:19.655
You ruined my life.

00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:23.295
You've completely shattered it. Do you get that?

00:07:23.455 --> 00:07:24.965
It was because I loved you.

00:07:25.365 --> 00:07:26.925
Because I love you!

00:07:26.995 --> 00:07:30.095
I had to do whatever it took to make you mine.

00:07:30.335 --> 00:07:33.605
Neither of us knew Kang Jae In would play us like this.

00:07:33.905 --> 00:07:36.575
We were happy before this happened.

00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:38.345
Don't be ridiculous.

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:43.575
A house built on sand is doomed to fall.

00:07:43.815 --> 00:07:45.615
Ji Ho thinks you're his father.

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:48.815
I thought he was your son too.

00:07:49.555 --> 00:07:52.625
I honestly had no idea until Teo showed up.

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:54.825
While I was living alone in the States,

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:58.425
I was so tired of counting the days waiting for you to come.

00:07:58.565 --> 00:07:59.825
I was lonely.

00:08:01.735 --> 00:08:02.735
So, I just...

00:08:03.635 --> 00:08:05.505
It was a mistake. It really was.

00:08:07.305 --> 00:08:10.535
I'm sorry, honey. I'm not hiding anything anymore.

00:08:10.975 --> 00:08:14.175
I couldn't tell you because I was terrified you'd leave me.

00:08:14.845 --> 00:08:18.185
I sold the house for you, for our family.

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:21.285
I only sold it because they offered more than the asking price.

00:08:21.615 --> 00:08:23.815
It was a trap set by Kang Jae In!

00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:28.925
Get out.

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:32.765
Honey, you have to believe me.

00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:34.935
Didn't you hear me? I said get out.

00:08:35.835 --> 00:08:36.835
Get out.

00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:42.675
Honey!

00:08:56.685 --> 00:08:58.825
Honey. Please believe me.

00:08:58.885 --> 00:08:59.885
Gi Chan!

00:09:01.795 --> 00:09:04.195
Please open the door, honey.

00:09:06.365 --> 00:09:09.095
You thieving tramp! You witch, come here!

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:10.365
You rotten tramp!

00:09:12.005 --> 00:09:13.205
You...

00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:16.705
seduced my son and wormed your way into being the chairman's wife.

00:09:16.805 --> 00:09:19.275
You caused all kinds of scandals,

00:09:19.545 --> 00:09:22.675
and on top of getting him fired, you even sold the house?

00:09:22.675 --> 00:09:25.085
Mother, it's a misunderstanding.

00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:27.745
I was scammed too!

00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:30.655
We're the ones who got conned. By you, you con artist!

00:09:30.685 --> 00:09:33.585
Ever since you came into our family, nothing has gone right.

00:09:33.585 --> 00:09:35.795
Gi Chan, help me!

00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:37.625
- You witch! - Na Ra!

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.795
Na Ra, please help me!

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:41.865
You witch...

00:09:43.295 --> 00:09:44.565
Just die!

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:46.705
You witch.

00:09:56.145 --> 00:09:59.085
Why don't you stay here for a while?

00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:02.615
I don't want to intrude when you spend time with your family.

00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:04.355
I'd just get in the way.

00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:06.125
Not at all.

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:08.455
When you think of this house, Teo,

00:10:09.655 --> 00:10:12.325
I don't want you to remember the bad times with Hwang Gi Chan's family.

00:10:12.565 --> 00:10:14.595
I want this place to be nothing...

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:17.465
but warm and happy memories.

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:21.505
After all, this is the house my dad built for me.

00:10:22.105 --> 00:10:25.605
They say it's rude to keep turning down a kind offer in Korea.

00:10:25.605 --> 00:10:26.645
Is that right?

00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:30.075
That's right. I'd be hurt if you said no.

00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:34.245
Okay. Thank you for letting me stay.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.425
Aunt Mi Ran, are you going to keep staying at Do Yun's?

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:42.795
I moved in to win over Oh Seong's sister.

00:10:44.655 --> 00:10:46.165
But like Seung Woo said,

00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:48.595
now that I've tried living in a full house,

00:10:48.735 --> 00:10:50.535
it feels so warm and full of life. I like it.

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:54.565
See? I told you. I was worried, so that's a relief.

00:10:56.835 --> 00:10:59.445
So I was thinking we could keep living like this for now,

00:10:59.545 --> 00:11:02.545
and then as soon as Oh Seong's new house is finished,

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:06.815
we could all move in together with his family.

00:11:10.285 --> 00:11:11.655
Seung Woo.

00:11:12.285 --> 00:11:14.785
Move back in with us.

00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:18.595
Can I really?

00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:20.325
Of course.

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:22.595
This is your home too, you know.

00:11:23.195 --> 00:11:24.335
Right, Mom?

00:11:25.205 --> 00:11:27.505
Yes. We're family, after all.

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:30.175
Unless you'd rather not.

00:11:30.835 --> 00:11:32.105
No, I want to!

00:11:32.945 --> 00:11:35.775
I'll pack my bags and be right over. Don't even try to stop me.

00:11:37.845 --> 00:11:41.885
Oh, right. Teo has decided to stay here too.

00:11:42.015 --> 00:11:43.015
You're okay with that, right?

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:46.785
Teo? Of course, that's okay. He's such a nice guy.

00:11:46.855 --> 00:11:50.595
I heard Teo helped bring down Hwang Gi Chan's family, right?

00:11:51.225 --> 00:11:54.865
That's right. I wanted to repay him, so I offered.

00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:58.735
I wish your father were here to see this.

00:12:01.465 --> 00:12:04.675
I can still picture him so clearly, coming out of his study.

00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:24.125
I told you, it's awkward having a stranger make us breakfast.

00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:25.695
She's not a stranger. I told you that.

00:12:25.695 --> 00:12:28.395
She's your sister-in-law now.

00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:37.775
She's trying to weasel her way in, but she can forget about it.

00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:43.475
You call this breakfast?

00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:47.785
I just put out something simple, what I usually have in the morning.

00:12:47.885 --> 00:12:51.385
On an empty stomach? Lemon water will upset our stomachs.

00:12:51.455 --> 00:12:55.495
I've been drinking it for a while, and it's always been fine for me.

00:12:55.555 --> 00:13:00.125
It can actually be good for people with healthy digestion.

00:13:02.165 --> 00:13:05.635
How is Bo Ram supposed to get through kindergarten on this?

00:13:06.935 --> 00:13:09.435
Bo Ram, I'll fry you an egg. Just wait a minute.

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:12.045
- Okay. - She's never raised a child.

00:13:12.045 --> 00:13:13.505
How would she know? Goodness.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:22.985
Hey, I like a simple breakfast. Come on, let's just eat.

00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:26.255
Bo Ram, you should finish up, too.

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:29.955
This is good.

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:38.705
I told Ji Ho and Gi Man to stay and draw together.

00:13:39.835 --> 00:13:43.135
How can we have a strategy meeting when we have no strategy?

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:46.105
You'd rather just keep living in this dump?

00:13:46.305 --> 00:13:49.275
Except for that time I had to drag you kids to live in a shantytown,

00:13:49.415 --> 00:13:51.375
I have never lived in a hovel like this.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.615
There's not even a bed, and they used such cheap flooring.

00:13:55.985 --> 00:13:59.325
It might as well be bare concrete. My entire body aches.

00:13:59.825 --> 00:14:02.725
Come on, Gi Chan said he was lucky to even find this place.

00:14:04.955 --> 00:14:06.525
Those paintings in the gallery...

00:14:06.725 --> 00:14:08.595
Are you sure they're worthless now?

00:14:09.565 --> 00:14:13.635
Since we can't sell them right now, we have to assume so.

00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:17.005
Then, let's just sell the gallery.

00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:19.605
It's on prime real estate, so it'll be worth a pretty penny.

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.945
What are you waiting for? So many of us are crammed in here.

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:27.785
Are we just going to keep living all crammed in like this?

00:14:29.015 --> 00:14:30.755
The gallery is our last resort.

00:14:31.385 --> 00:14:32.685
We can't do it right now.

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:38.865
But...

00:14:38.995 --> 00:14:40.265
Then you sell your house.

00:14:40.495 --> 00:14:42.195
You have a home in the US, right?

00:14:42.735 --> 00:14:46.165
If you'll mooch after ruining us, you'd better do something.

00:14:46.465 --> 00:14:48.435
My aunt is living in my house in the US.

00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:52.175
I'll ask my aunt to list it with a real estate agent.

00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:57.545
What are you talking about?

00:14:58.615 --> 00:15:00.145
But I never sold it.

00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:05.015
My aunt did?

00:15:07.325 --> 00:15:09.795
What is it? What's wrong now?

00:15:10.225 --> 00:15:12.425
It looks like my aunt had gambling debts.

00:15:13.765 --> 00:15:15.965
She even sold my house and then disappeared.

00:15:17.065 --> 00:15:18.365
What?

00:15:18.605 --> 00:15:20.535
This is so frustrating.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:24.435
See? The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:27.605
There's a reason they say you should vet the family, not just the person.

00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:30.045
Just drop it! I'll handle this myself.

(YL Planning and Design Team)

00:15:34.985 --> 00:15:37.015
You can glare all you want. I'm not scared.

00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:38.455
Spit it out.

00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:41.525
I hear you scammed us out of our house.

00:15:41.825 --> 00:15:43.495
That's a crime.

00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:47.465
Why don't you worry about your son, who will rot in prison for life?

00:15:52.165 --> 00:15:53.805
I'll sell you the gallery.

00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:57.075
Your mother can be the director again for all I care.

00:15:57.205 --> 00:15:58.745
I was about to sell it to someone else,

00:15:58.745 --> 00:16:00.405
but I came to you first.

00:16:01.145 --> 00:16:03.915
I'll sell it for less, so buy it.

00:16:04.045 --> 00:16:05.515
And you don't have to thank me.

00:16:05.785 --> 00:16:07.515
I'm sure it's because I'm the only one...

00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:09.015
who'd buy such a troubled gallery.

00:16:09.685 --> 00:16:10.915
But what a shame.

00:16:11.185 --> 00:16:13.185
I don't think I'll have to buy it from you.

00:16:14.185 --> 00:16:17.455

Don't worry. I'll force an auction and take the gallery myself.

Get ready for a tax investigation.

00:16:51.895 --> 00:16:52.925
What?

00:16:53.265 --> 00:16:56.565
For what? I haven't done anything! I'll be proven innocent!

00:16:56.695 --> 00:16:59.905
After you became the director, you signed things blindly, right?

00:17:01.265 --> 00:17:03.235
Don't tell me...

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:07.175
They were meant to frame you for all kinds of tax evasion.

00:17:08.605 --> 00:17:09.715
And you were so excited,

00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:11.575
you signed everything without a second thought.

00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:14.085
You conniving fox!

00:17:14.085 --> 00:17:16.785
That's why you made me the director!

00:17:18.055 --> 00:17:19.755
Are you just figuring that out now?

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:23.455
Real quick on the uptake.

00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:27.495
You...

00:17:29.435 --> 00:17:32.565
Jae In came to thank you for her mom,

00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:34.305
but you told her not to bother.

00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:37.605
So instead, she bought many things from our store.

00:17:37.635 --> 00:17:39.375
She wanted to give them to you as a gift.

00:17:39.805 --> 00:17:41.445
This one's for you, Dad.

00:17:41.905 --> 00:17:43.575
She really shouldn't have.

00:17:50.585 --> 00:17:54.385
Lie down and try it. It soothes sore and knotted muscles.

00:18:03.935 --> 00:18:05.805
It's so nice and warm.

00:18:06.165 --> 00:18:09.105
The heat will help with your blood circulation, too.

00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:16.445
I said to forget about it, but I guess I should thank her now.

00:18:25.015 --> 00:18:27.855
Who are you planning to take down this time to see me?

00:18:36.095 --> 00:18:37.595
I found this in Ji Ho's room.

00:18:38.295 --> 00:18:39.635
I think they're Kang Se Ri's pants,

00:18:40.705 --> 00:18:42.175
and there's some kind of stain on them.

00:18:43.305 --> 00:18:44.975
I think it might be blood.

00:18:48.045 --> 00:18:49.615
You can be the judge of that,

00:18:50.545 --> 00:18:52.885
but the fact that they were hidden under the bed...

00:18:54.385 --> 00:18:55.815
My mother...

00:18:56.455 --> 00:18:57.615
said that when your brother...

00:18:58.755 --> 00:19:00.085
had his accident,

00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:03.425
she saw Kang Se Ri on the stairs.

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:09.465
She has dementia, so she could be mistaken,

00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:11.865
but that doesn't make it any less credible.

00:19:12.265 --> 00:19:13.335
And about Kang Se Ri...

00:19:14.935 --> 00:19:16.435
When your brother was injured,

00:19:17.675 --> 00:19:20.245
I caught her trying to take him off his respirator.

00:19:21.805 --> 00:19:22.975
Isn't that strange?

00:19:26.385 --> 00:19:27.845
Don't ask Kang Se Ri about it.

00:19:28.715 --> 00:19:30.655
Get a DNA test done on it.

00:19:31.115 --> 00:19:32.285
That's the right first step.

00:19:38.025 --> 00:19:39.695
I thought you found my family despicable.

00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:43.035
Why the sudden concern for me?

00:19:44.195 --> 00:19:45.505
After putting me through torment,

00:19:45.805 --> 00:19:48.305
are you offering me a single drop of water and calling it mercy?

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:50.575
Don't think for a second this is for you.

00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:53.645
If Kang Se Ri is guilty of more,

00:19:54.045 --> 00:19:56.175
I want her to get the maximum sentence.

00:19:59.345 --> 00:20:00.445
I'm leaving.

00:20:27.105 --> 00:20:30.975
I begged you, and I pleaded with you to just wait.

00:20:31.515 --> 00:20:32.915
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:20:33.485 --> 00:20:34.885
I told you I'd handle it.

00:20:34.985 --> 00:20:39.125
You and Kang Jae In have completely ruined my life.

00:20:39.725 --> 00:20:41.485
You need to take responsibility for everything!

00:20:41.925 --> 00:20:44.025
You've got some nerve. You lived as someone else.

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:46.965
Kang Se Ri, if your life is a mess,

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:48.795
don't blame me or Kang Jae In.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.195
You have only yourself to blame.

00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:53.905
- I said, blame yourself. - You don't understand.

00:20:54.405 --> 00:20:56.375
It was all for Ji Ho.

00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:59.705
I just wanted to give our Ji Ho a happy life.

00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:06.815
If you want Ji Ho that badly, I'll bring him to you.

00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:10.685
I know it's late, but the three of us can start over.

00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:13.155
I'll do better. Okay?

00:21:15.555 --> 00:21:16.625
Kang Se Ri,

00:21:17.225 --> 00:21:18.455
are you out of your mind?

00:21:19.265 --> 00:21:21.565
I couldn't believe it, but you've really lost it.

00:21:22.795 --> 00:21:25.635
Teo, can't you please try to understand?

00:21:25.905 --> 00:21:27.805
I'm not saying what I did was right.

00:21:28.205 --> 00:21:29.275
Stop it.

00:21:29.805 --> 00:21:31.375
You're giving me the creeps, so stop.

00:21:32.945 --> 00:21:34.475
I have no feelings left for you,

00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:37.115
and I'm not getting back with you, so don't even dream about it.

00:21:38.415 --> 00:21:39.985
I'm going to raise Ji Ho.

00:21:40.845 --> 00:21:42.185
I'm preparing a paternity suit,

00:21:42.855 --> 00:21:45.255
and I've already told Hwang Gi Chan, just so you know.

00:22:21.885 --> 00:22:23.325
Why are you so surprised?

00:22:25.765 --> 00:22:28.495
I thought you were at work. You startled me.

00:22:28.795 --> 00:22:29.965
Where have you been?

00:22:30.595 --> 00:22:32.705
I just came back for something I forgot.

00:22:41.745 --> 00:22:43.975
(If something happens to me, Se Ri is behind it.)

00:22:44.615 --> 00:22:47.715
I drew a really cool picture. Do you want to see it?

00:22:49.485 --> 00:22:51.085
It's an angel. Isn't it pretty?

00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:52.985
Yes.

00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:57.155
Do you want to see another? It's so good, you'll be shocked.

00:22:57.325 --> 00:22:58.525
Ta-da!

00:23:11.735 --> 00:23:12.745
Pretty good, right?

00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:15.005
Gi Man.

00:23:15.775 --> 00:23:17.215
When you fell down the stairs,

00:23:17.845 --> 00:23:19.245
did someone push you?

00:23:20.215 --> 00:23:21.285
What?

00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:23.285
Was someone with you?

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:25.055
Do you remember who?

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:38.495
Your family's a mess, and you're over here smiling?

00:23:39.405 --> 00:23:41.035
Gosh, what?

00:23:41.405 --> 00:23:42.735
It was Assistant Manager Kang...

00:23:42.735 --> 00:23:44.035
who texted first to ask if I was okay.

00:23:46.245 --> 00:23:49.915
You really like that Kang Seung Woo guy that much?

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:52.545
Of course I do. What's not to like? I totally like him.

00:23:53.885 --> 00:23:54.885
Hold on a second.

00:23:55.715 --> 00:23:57.415
If I make him my son-in-law,

00:23:58.085 --> 00:24:01.985
that's a bigger prize than bringing that vixen Kang Jae In home.

00:24:03.355 --> 00:24:06.825
Should I put my mind to it and get those two together?

00:24:11.165 --> 00:24:13.605
(YL Group)

00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:16.575
- Come on, hurry up. - Mom, are you crazy?

00:24:16.835 --> 00:24:18.705
Why are you here? Get out! Hurry!

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:21.775
You said you liked Kang Seung Woo, didn't you?

00:24:22.345 --> 00:24:23.745
I think he's pretty decent myself.

00:24:25.145 --> 00:24:27.585
We should've looked for a match for you closer to home.

00:24:27.645 --> 00:24:28.685
All that wasted effort.

00:24:29.115 --> 00:24:33.155
His mother is YL Group's director, and his father is DH Holdings' CEO.

00:24:33.155 --> 00:24:34.755
He's the biggest catch there is.

00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:38.755
Oh, Na Ra.

00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:46.805
Goodness, Na Ra kept going on and on about how much she missed you.

00:24:47.065 --> 00:24:50.035
As her mother, I felt so bad for her that I just had to bring her.

00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:54.545
I don't like you anymore.

00:24:55.405 --> 00:24:57.375
What are you talking about? You said you did!

00:24:57.775 --> 00:24:59.715
You were all smiles just from his text message.

00:24:59.945 --> 00:25:02.345
No, I don't! I said I don't! I stopped liking him!

00:25:04.185 --> 00:25:06.385
It hurts my pride being the only one with feelings,

00:25:06.725 --> 00:25:09.085
and my heart pounds even when you just worry about me.

00:25:09.355 --> 00:25:11.295
So I'm pretty sure it's terrible for my health.

00:25:12.255 --> 00:25:13.895
So I'm going to stop liking you now.

00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:15.865
- Mom, let's go. - Hey!

00:25:15.935 --> 00:25:17.835
- Come on, let's go! - But...

00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:23.575
It sounds like she still likes me.

00:25:27.605 --> 00:25:30.445
You get back in there right now. Go tell him you're crazy about him.

00:25:30.575 --> 00:25:32.015
No! I can't! I'm not doing it!

00:25:32.415 --> 00:25:33.645
Why should I have to do that?

00:25:34.415 --> 00:25:37.385
You said you liked him, so I'm setting the stage for you!

00:25:38.215 --> 00:25:40.325
You should at least try to properly seduce him.

00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:45.755
Not YL Group, but DH Holdings will all be his one day, won't it?

00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:49.565
If all else fails, sleep with him and make him yours.

00:25:50.735 --> 00:25:53.405
I didn't fall for him because of his background.

00:25:53.765 --> 00:25:55.505
Don't treat my love life like a business deal.

00:25:56.135 --> 00:25:57.505
Love? Don't make me laugh.

00:25:57.905 --> 00:26:00.075
You saw me lose six million over a man,

00:26:00.075 --> 00:26:01.905
and you still dare talk about love?

00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:05.315
- Just make Kang Seung Woo yours! - No!

00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:08.585
If you won't, pay back everything I've spent raising you!

00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:14.225
All that money for surgery and spas to help you marry rich! Pay it back!

00:26:15.255 --> 00:26:17.425
Fine. Take your pound of flesh for all I care.

00:26:17.495 --> 00:26:18.625
Why, you...

00:26:20.165 --> 00:26:24.695
Gosh, why can't any of my children ever do what I want?

00:26:25.195 --> 00:26:26.205
Gosh.

00:26:26.865 --> 00:26:28.105
I can't live like this.

00:26:28.735 --> 00:26:29.935
I'm Kang Jae In.

00:26:30.435 --> 00:26:32.075
How am I meant to live in this tiny, godforsaken place?

00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:34.805
I have to get out of here, no matter what.

00:26:35.575 --> 00:26:36.815
I have to find a way.

00:26:39.315 --> 00:26:40.945
She must think I'm a gold digger just like her.

00:26:42.285 --> 00:26:45.615
Hey, Na Ra. Look at this. See this hole in my head?

00:26:46.555 --> 00:26:49.255
Gi Chan pulled out a whole bunch of my hair last time.

00:26:49.695 --> 00:26:50.895
You have to tell him off for me.

00:26:52.295 --> 00:26:54.465
Gi Man, that's ridiculous.

00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:57.095
Why on earth would Gi Chan want to pull out your hair?

00:27:01.165 --> 00:27:02.265
Where's Kang Se Ri?

00:27:04.375 --> 00:27:06.375
Honey, I'm right here.

00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:11.615
Was it you who pushed my brother down the stairs?

00:27:12.145 --> 00:27:13.145
Honey!

00:27:16.155 --> 00:27:18.285
What's all this commotion?

00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:21.685
Gi Chan, you're going to kill her! Stop it!

00:27:24.295 --> 00:27:27.525
What did that wicked witch do now to cause all this chaos?

00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:31.235
It's about Gi Man. Kang Se Ri is the one who did this to him.

00:27:31.595 --> 00:27:33.505
What are you talking about?

00:27:34.635 --> 00:27:37.735
Gi Man. Who did you say pushed you down the stairs?

00:27:39.775 --> 00:27:43.415
That witch gave me a hard shove, like this.

00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:46.385
He's lying.

00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:49.785
He's not in his right mind. How can you believe his lies?

00:27:50.315 --> 00:27:52.015
Mother, it's not true.

00:27:52.855 --> 00:27:54.525
Why would I ever push him?

00:27:54.825 --> 00:27:57.395
- I have no reason to. - Shut your mouth!

00:27:59.295 --> 00:28:00.825
It was because he was the first one to find out.

00:28:01.595 --> 00:28:02.765
He knew about Ji Ho.

00:28:06.565 --> 00:28:07.705
What about Ji Ho?

00:28:08.165 --> 00:28:11.475
You're the one who hid the pants under the bed in Ji Ho's room!

00:28:12.375 --> 00:28:15.645
I had the blood on the pants tested. It matched my brother's DNA.

00:28:17.275 --> 00:28:19.385
I just got the test results.

00:28:19.985 --> 00:28:21.445
Are you still going to deny it now?

00:28:28.125 --> 00:28:29.595
- Oh my gosh! - I can't believe it...

00:28:30.095 --> 00:28:32.155
You witch! You deserve to die, you witch!

00:28:34.025 --> 00:28:36.465
You witch! You deserve to die! You witch!

00:28:36.995 --> 00:28:40.435
This witch is ruining our family! She's tearing our family apart!

00:28:41.035 --> 00:28:45.075
- You murderous witch! - No! I swear, it wasn't me!

00:28:45.575 --> 00:28:47.845
Honey, you have to help me!

00:28:49.515 --> 00:28:50.975
Mother, that's enough.

00:28:51.545 --> 00:28:53.945
She's not even worth hitting. Just call the police.

00:28:55.415 --> 00:28:56.415
Honey!

00:28:56.755 --> 00:28:57.755
Hwang Na Ra.

00:28:58.255 --> 00:28:59.955
- Yes? - Call the police.

00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:01.525
Report her for attempted murder.

00:29:01.525 --> 00:29:03.525
Use the pants and documents as evidence.

00:29:06.395 --> 00:29:10.335
Get that witch! Catch the murderer! Get her! Catch her!

00:29:10.535 --> 00:29:11.535
Get her!

00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:15.965
Mom.

00:29:17.235 --> 00:29:18.405
Mom, are you okay?

00:29:18.975 --> 00:29:20.075
You fell?

00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:29.215
- Goodness... - You were right, Mom.

00:29:31.815 --> 00:29:33.525
I'm the one who ruined this family.

00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:37.625
Gi Man, I'm sorry.

00:29:40.565 --> 00:29:41.565
I'm so sorry.

00:29:42.395 --> 00:29:44.765
Gi Chan, don't be like this.

00:29:47.705 --> 00:29:49.605
So what if you ruined things? Just build them back up.

00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:52.535
So why are you sitting there feeling sorry for yourself?

00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:54.345
You're the pillar of this family.

00:29:54.675 --> 00:29:56.215
And a pillar can't be allowed to crumble.

00:29:56.675 --> 00:29:59.015
So pull yourself together and get back on your feet!

00:30:06.755 --> 00:30:07.755
I will rest for a bit.

00:30:54.265 --> 00:30:55.435
I'll stop by again sometime.

00:30:55.965 --> 00:30:57.775
I just came to say hi since I heard you transferred hospitals.

00:30:57.905 --> 00:31:00.475
An emergency surgery just came up. Let's grab a drink some other time.

00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:01.845
- Yes. - Go on.

00:31:27.835 --> 00:31:30.435
Did something happen during your lunch meeting?

00:31:33.275 --> 00:31:34.305
Was it that obvious?

00:31:35.305 --> 00:31:36.445
What happened?

00:31:39.145 --> 00:31:40.145
It's about Hwang Gi Chan.

00:31:43.655 --> 00:31:44.785
He has terminal stomach cancer.

00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:50.455
Looks like he has a year at most.

00:31:55.295 --> 00:31:58.095
Are you okay, Do Yun?

00:32:00.735 --> 00:32:01.905
You're not worried about Hwang Gi Chan.

00:32:02.665 --> 00:32:03.905
You're worried about me?

00:32:04.935 --> 00:32:06.775
He hasn't paid the price for what he did to Do Hee,

00:32:07.645 --> 00:32:09.175
not properly, anyway.

00:32:11.575 --> 00:32:15.245
I know how much you've held back for that day...

00:32:16.215 --> 00:32:17.215
better than anyone.

00:32:22.285 --> 00:32:23.355
That's all I need.

00:32:24.655 --> 00:32:26.225
Just knowing that you understand, Jae In.

00:32:27.665 --> 00:32:30.395
With that, I can endure it.

00:32:32.265 --> 00:32:33.335
I can tolerate it.

00:32:35.805 --> 00:32:36.835
And I can breathe.

00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:52.555
Are you bored now that you got rid of me?

00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:55.725
You called me out here. Why the silent treatment?

00:32:56.525 --> 00:32:58.555
- Just say something... - I heard you were dying.

00:33:02.965 --> 00:33:04.235
Who gave you permission to die?

00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:53.215
(Queen's House)

00:33:53.515 --> 00:33:54.745
It's me, Mr. Hong.

00:33:55.145 --> 00:33:59.115
You know if I talk to prosecutors, you'll end up in here too.

00:33:59.485 --> 00:34:01.585
I just found this at Hwang Gi Chan's place.

00:34:01.655 --> 00:34:04.795
If we want to see what's inside, we have to crack the password first.

00:34:04.895 --> 00:34:06.195
You can't report me!

00:34:06.465 --> 00:34:08.525
- And why not? - Because I have definitive proof...

00:34:08.665 --> 00:34:12.295
that Gi Chan murdered Kim Do Hee.

00:34:12.495 --> 00:34:14.005
I was so wrong.

00:34:14.565 --> 00:34:16.065
In my final moments,

00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:18.775
could you be the one by my side?
