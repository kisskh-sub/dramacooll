00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.030
My hands are

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.320
getting weaker and weaker.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.290
This feeling is terrifying.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.710
But it doesn't matter.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.070
He doesn't let me paint anyway.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.200
I can only paint in secret every day.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.550
He? Who is he?

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.440
Do you think I'll get better?

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.070
Of course you will.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.480
I'll be back soon,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.510
and I'll come see you first thing.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.880
The world keeps repeating,

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.350
and the pain keeps multiplying.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.720
I'm in so much pain,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.730
so much so that I can't breathe.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.590
Every single second,

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.850
it feels like I'm being torn into pieces.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:24.790
Every time I think

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.160
I've made it through the worst moments,

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.330
I discover...

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.200
that it's all happening again.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.310
Eight years ago,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.440
Feng Wanqing

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.550
received early experimental RAN treatment

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.030
at Mourn Vale Medical Center.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.960
At that time,

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.830
those drugs were

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.760
still in the animal testing phase.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.510
The treatment

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.300
was absolutely illegal.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.310
It definitely wasn't just Feng Wanqing

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.960
receiving early experimental RAN treatment

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.030
at Mourn Vale Medical Center.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.200
That small laboratory

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.190
could conduct experiments on many people.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.480
There,

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.530
they were all terminal patients
on their death beds.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.510
They had no other options

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.770
and never complained.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.640
Any so-called new drug,

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.320
for them,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.480
could be a lifesaver.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.850
The RAN technology on Wanqing

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.720
achieved a major breakthrough.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:36.480
At least

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.160
in the final days of her life,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.920
she was once declared

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.310
cured.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.440
This is a medical miracle.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.310
Heaven has finally given us a chance

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.860
to spend the rest of our lives together.

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:16.900
But

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.510
this brief recovery

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.500
only lasted seven days.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.790
After seven days,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.200
Wanqing's condition

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.530
deteriorated rapidly.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.680
Her body failed quickly.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.790
She endured her final days

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.350
in extreme agony.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.550
She said...

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.880
she was in too much pain.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.440
The world keeps repeating,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.760
and the pain keeps multiplying.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.980
She wanted to leave this world urgently.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.570
But she couldn't

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.010
bear to leave someone behind.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.750
At that stage,

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.590
only two people had access

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.880
to RAN technology

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.280
and experimental drugs:

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.360
Mo Yuanzhi and Jiang Yuwen.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.270
And the one who wants

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.220
Feng Wanqing to stay in this world

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.910
must be him.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.610
Dr. An's car was

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.270
indeed fitted with a tracker.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.270
Feng Qiming;

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.450
32 years old;

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.350
originally from Lanxi Town in Hua'ao.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.270
At the age of 12,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.400
he attended a sports school in Mabu.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.960
At the age of 18,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.230
he severely injured someone

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.360
in a fight at school

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.280
and served 15 years in prison in Mabu.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.030
Ye Kun must be

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.159
his false identity
after returning to his home country.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.739
This phone number of Ye Kun is new.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.360
The only call record today

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.710
is a missed call.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.340
The caller was

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.500
inside the Moma building at that time.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:52.510
What is this?

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:54.240
A signal jammer.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.710
I'm not sure

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.240
if you're being monitored.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.460
What do you want to tell me?

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.250
I need your help.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.920
With some things,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.670
only you...

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.510
would believe me.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:22.920
Remember

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.920
the phrase in Feng Wanqing's diary:

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.280
"The world keeps repeating,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.140
and the pain keeps multiplying"?

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.090
How do you interpret it?

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.040
She was talking about

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.000
the torment of illness

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.180
being endless.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.480
I think the repetition...

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360
refers to a loop.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.920
I know what I'm saying sounds crazy.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.510
You... You have no reason to believe me,

00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:59.150
but

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.590
it's actually really happening.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.800
This world enters a loop

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.110
every once in a while,

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.800
and this day

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.190
repeats over and over

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.360
until the loop ends.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:09.630
All people and creatures

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.360
don't remember what happened.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.550
Then,

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.070
if nobody remembers,

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.830
who can prove the loop exists?

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:25.880
I can.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.230
I don't know how to explain it,

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.150
and I don't know why,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.710
but...

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.110
I'm different from everyone else.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:43.960
I can remember everything that happened.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.880
I can even change

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.510
the outcomes of events on this day.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.440
Many people think
I can predict the future,

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.030
but...

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.160
I just have the memories.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.000
I know what will happen,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.530
so I can anticipate things.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.230
You...

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.880
still don't believe me, do you?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.280
Do you think I'm crazy?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.720
Come with me.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.230
In the past two years,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.000
in my RAN experiments,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.550
two strange things happened

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.190
that I cannot explain.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.070
I haven't told anyone about it

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.710
because I know

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.630
nobody would believe me.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.550
To explain these experimental phenomena,

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.810
I've looked through countless theories

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.320
in the branches of biology,

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.360
ethology,

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.840
chemistry, psychology,

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.510
and

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.000
physics.

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.070
Among all the possibilities
I've deduced,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.440
there is also

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.370
this answer.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.260
[Foreknowledge?]

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.930
When I wrote down this deduction,

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.320
I was also

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.320
wondering if I had gone mad.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.880
But among all these deductions,

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.340
only this one

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.380
perfectly explains RN356's behavior.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.000
What is RN356?

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.510
It was

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:29.000
a lab mouse with abnormal behavior.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.590
Indeed,

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.550
I'm the type

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.320
to bring lab mice home.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.070
I need to constantly monitor

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:50.770
my special test subjects.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.000
This maze is used

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.280
to test the memory

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.280
and learning abilities of lab mice.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.740
It's even more complex
than the Tolman maze.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.150
A year ago,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.510
I used it to test

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.320
the effects

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.670
of RAN-Y on neural repair in mice.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.480
I used two groups of lab mice.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.800
One group had neural defects,

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.600
and the other were healthy mice.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.710
I injected the reagent

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.320
into all the mice,

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.840
but nothing happened.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.000
The vital signs of both groups

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.860
remained exactly the same
as before the injection.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.760
Just when I thought

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.620
the experiment was going to fail,

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.230
I suddenly discovered

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.150
that in the healthy group,

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.480
there was one strange mouse.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.880
Its code name was RN356.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.920
It had a special ability.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.960
No matter how I changed the maze,

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.320
it could accurately avoid dangers

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.480
and precisely locate the food reward.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.150
After numerous experiments,

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.510
I discovered that RN356's ability

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.110
didn't come from

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.150
repeated learning and memory,

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.070
but rather seemed like

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.110
a kind of inexplicable

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:22.400
foreknowledge.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.920
It was too special.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.360
So,

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.480
I reported the results

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.440
to the chief scientist at that time,

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.300
Tang Shaorong.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.230
However,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.230
when I wanted to
demonstrate it to Mr. Tang,

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.880
RN356 had lost this ability.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.880
This proves that your discovery

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.210
was just a coincidence.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.760
This kind of experimental data

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.090
can't be used for scientific research

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.600
or in experimental reports.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.200
If you have any doubts,

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:55.710
you can dissect RN356 to examine

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960
its neural system

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.550
for any peculiarities.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.710
But I suspect

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.630
you won't find anything.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.320
So I brought RN356 home.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.760
Almost daily,

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.670
I conducted the same experiment,

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.480
until its predictive ability

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.590
appeared again.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.190
It only possessed this ability

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.480
on specific days.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.880
I kept records.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.880
But these dates showed

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.550
no pattern at all.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.800
January 1, 2023.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:57.510
February 25.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:00.590
March 3.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.920
March 29.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.920
April 16.

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.300
May 19.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:13.150
Right?

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:19.280
These are...

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:21.670
all loop days.
