00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.480
Even though we gathered allies
from other towns.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.920
I still think it’s not enough.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920
Do you have any way to find more?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.880
I’ve heard in the foothill forest.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.479
There are villagers fleeing
the tattoo draft.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.920
Our scouts reported.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.360
Somdet Saenyakon.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.320
Sent spies tailing Kosol’s group
without fail.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440
Hey, everyone hide!

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.520
Stay together and follow me!

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.680
So you’re the officials.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.520
Here to drag us back, right?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.039
No. We’re here to invite you
to rise against the officials.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.960
Your village is really lovely.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.880
So calm and quiet.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.000
Phai!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.800
You betrayed us
and sided with the officials?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.400
Attack!

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.680
No!

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.000
Hear me out.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.480
They mean well. They’re here
to take us home.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.440
No more hiding in this forest
like fugitives.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.079
It’s true. Look at our faces.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.600
Do we look like the kind who’d enslave you?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.560
If you want to know how we’ll help you.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.160
I’ll tell you now.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.000
I believe every one of you.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Loves freedom and wants
a life of your own.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.600
Not to be anyone’s property.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.920
Nor serve anyone else.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.160
And all who love freedom.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.560
Should live with dignity.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.560
And share equal rights.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.880
But the oppressive system.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.360
Forced you to flee
into the forest.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.680
How long will you keep hiding?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.760
For generations to come?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.520
Now I have seized
the city of Singhanakhon.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.560
I want you all to go home.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.480
And join as one force.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.120
To fight the true source
of all this.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.320
That Somdet Saenyakon,
who holds power now.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.600
Who will stand with me?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.480
Nothing in this world
comes easily.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.080
And this fight.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.800
May cost us blood.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.880
And flesh.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.400
But it’ll be worth it.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.920
For the freedom we will gain.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.400
We must rise and fight.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.880
I’ll go back with you myself.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.320
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.760
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.080
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.040
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.000
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.480
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.520
- I’ll go too.
- I’ll go too.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.720
Then tonight will be the last night
we stay here.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.960
Let’s have a farewell feast.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.520
Why sit alone, brother?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.400
Go dance with Worradej.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.520
Are you mad?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.240
I won’t do something
so embarrassing.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.640
Come on, don’t be so shy.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.280
Or someone else
might snatch him.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.560
Don’t blame me then.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.560
Come on, brother.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.240
Chances like this
don’t come easy.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.760
No.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.240
I’d rather die than go dance.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.360
Hey, Kosol.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.440
Dance with me, it’ll be fun.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.680
I don’t get it.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.880
Why are you so eager
for me to dance?

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.280
Because you.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.040
You’ve kept a straight face
since the journey.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.600
So I was worried.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.760
That your face might cramp up.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.520
Now that we’ve finished
our mission.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.880
Let’s do something fun
to relax a bit.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.640
Come on, dance with me.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.280
- No.
- Please.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.200
I said no means no.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.600
Why not?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.360
No means no. No reason needed.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.920
Worradej.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.520
If you don’t mind.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.600
Would you dance with me?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.400
With pleasure.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.120
Let’s go.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.800
See?

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.280
He got snatched away.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.880
Don’t blame me now.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.480
Your Majesty, please come dance.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.760
- What the,
- Kosol!

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.000
Kosol!

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.760
You can’t take Worradej away!

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.400
Let me go!

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.440
Let go! I said let go!

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.080
Let go, ah!

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.080
Hey!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.840
I’m not a doll you can just
carry around!

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.640
I was dancing with Banjong.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.480
You’ve no right
to kidnap me like this!

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.720
Wait!

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.040
Didn’t you ask me
to dance with you?

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.040
So I brought you here
to dance with me.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.000
Hey.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.520
If you want to dance with me.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.000
Why drag me this deep
into the woods?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.360
Can’t you do things
like normal folks?

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.360
I’m shy.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.680
I can’t dance.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.320
But if it’s swordplay,
I’m pretty good.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.960
When it comes to dancing.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.720
I’m hopeless.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.760
So I want you to teach me.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.400
Look, dancing’s just for fun.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.160
There’s no right or wrong.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.920
People dance to enjoy.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.680
Come on, Worradej.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.000
Teach me, please.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.680
Then I’ll teach you.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400
Let’s start with forming the circle.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.960
Do you know how?

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.000
Like this.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.640
Make it a bit more graceful.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.840
Here.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.760
Bend it up.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.280
Okay.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.200
Next, the other hand makes a lotus.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.800
Like this, a lotus.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.880
Keep it graceful.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.080
Don’t bend your arm.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.120
Bend like this, yes, the hand.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.480
Okay.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.080
Now I’ll give the beat.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.320
It goes one, two, three, four.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.240
Then switch to the other side.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.800
Three, four.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.520
Uh-huh, try it.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.440
One, two, three, four.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800
Okay?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.640
One, two, three, four.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.600
One, two, three, four.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.680
One, two, three, four.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.800
One, two, three, four.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.640
One, two, three,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.000
Don’t laugh at me.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.440
I just find you endearing.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.800
You’re dancing so stiffly.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.640
If it’s not your thing,
don’t force it.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.680
I’m forcing myself for you.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.160
Because I want
to dance with you.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.880
Like other lovers do.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.480
Then…

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.960
If you want to dance with me.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.720
Shall we go back
to the village?

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.880
Here.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.160
There’s no one around.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.080
It’s more fun with others,
and there’s no music. Come on.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.000
I want to be here with you,
just us two.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.680
We don’t need music.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.400
It’s already in my heart.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.840
I’m not jealous.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.160
Not jealous, but restless.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.880
Since Lord Kosol carried
my master away.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.280
No need to follow.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.080
He’ll be back soon.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.360
I wasn’t going to follow.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.200
I’m sure Worradej
will choose me anyway.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.200
That sure of yourself?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.600
This is way harder
than swordplay.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.200
Worradej.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.000
Don’t tell anyone.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.600
That I danced with you.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.920
I let only you see this side of me.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.480
Why not? Hey.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.960
You’re a warrior.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.400
But you can dance too,
it’s actually cute.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.280
Really cute?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.560
Of course. Cute.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.040
Then do you love me?

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.720
What’s with you?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.560
How did it get to this?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.680
You’ve been dodging me all along.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.240
Every time I asked
how you feel about me.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.920
I don’t care.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.960
You must answer me today.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.960
If you don’t, I won’t let you
leave this forest.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.560
We’ll just stay here together.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.240
Hey, didn’t you say
you wanted to dance with me?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.760
So you tricked me
into a trap, huh?

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.320
I don’t mind being in the woods.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.880
Plenty of ozone here, I like it.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.480
You’re dodging me again.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.720
But I think I can already guess
from your actions.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.680
What your answer really is.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.400
What we had before.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.800
Was only physical pleasure.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.840
Something you wanted from me.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.960
There was never any depth of heart.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.280
It’s my fault.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.440
For feeling it alone.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.040
Go back.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.960
And don’t toy with my heart again.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.920
Wait, Kosol!

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.640
Give me a moment
to think of an answer.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.880
Oh man…

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.520
Such a world-shaking problem.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.000
If only P’Oi and P’Chod were here.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.400
But right now.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.680
I’m all alone.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.720
So then.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.920
I’ll just be my own advisor first.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.040
What do you think, Worradej?

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.480
This body belongs to me.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.480
So you should choose Banjong.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.160
Because I love Banjong.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.600
You should choose him
for my desire’s sake.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.040
But…

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.000
You’re already dead, Worradej.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.400
I’m the one living
in this body now.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.840
That’s me.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.040
So I should choose Kosol.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.640
To follow my own desire,
that’d be right.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.440
And how do you know.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.440
That Kosol loves me.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.480
Or loves you, Prince?

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.920
Exactly.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.840
If Kosol loves Worradej.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.840
Wouldn’t that be imposture?

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.080
And that would mean.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.200
He doesn’t love us
for who we truly are.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.400
If we stay like this,
it won’t last.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.680
What should I do?

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.600
Ugh, my head hurts.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.040
So now you can give me
an answer, right?

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.160
Mm.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.720
But before I answer you.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.600
Let me ask you something.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.640
Earlier, you once said.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.920
That I.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.720
Before drinking poison
and after drinking it.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.720
Seemed like two different people.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.440
So which one do you love?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.280
Such a strange question.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.720
You talk as if you’re two people.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.320
To me.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.000
You’re still the same Worradej.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.800
The one with fierce determination.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.240
The only difference is.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.760
Back then you spoke less.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.840
Now you talk more, that’s all.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.000
That’s all, really?

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.800
That’s all.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.440
So.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.240
Do you love the quiet one.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.280
Or the talkative one more?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.520
Whether it’s you back then,
quiet.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.680
Or you now.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.120
Made talkative by the poison.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.800
I believe inside
you’re still the same.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.320
Don’t worry, Worradej.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.040
Be whoever you are.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.080
Just be yourself, that’s enough.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.760
That’s the you I love.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.680
How lucky I am.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.320
That in this world.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.080
There’s someone who truly
loves my real self.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.480
And I love his true self too.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.320
Kosol.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.560
I love you.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.680
I’ve waited so long to hear this,
Worradej.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.960
I love you too.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.680
And I won’t give you the chance
to reject me again.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.800
What are you going to do?

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.400
I’ll do this.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.599
Since tonight.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:16.960
Is already special.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.520
Let’s do something…

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.839
That’ll make it unforgettable.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.720
It’s dark, walk carefully, sir.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.560
Watch out for wild beasts?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.720
Nothing’s scarier now
than Lord Kosol.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.520
Don’t you smile.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.680
I’m itching all over now.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.840
Got bitten on the butt by ants!

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.920
And who was it.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.880
That said tonight would be
unforgettable?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.200
I’ll remember it till I die!

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.160
I got stabbed by rocks too.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.920
So…

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.720
Did you like it?

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.640
I did.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.520
It’s like turning into
a wild beast.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.200
Living by instinct
in the middle of nature.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.040
Hey.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.720
Crazy.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.720
Thanks.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.280
But you don’t need
to comfort me.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.680
You… you…

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.320
What’s wrong with you?

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.320
Kosol!

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.000
What on earth happened?

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.920
Count!

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.920
Phai!

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.880
Hey!

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.400
What’s going on?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.240
Why is it like this?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.040
Soldiers from the palace.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.920
They killed everyone.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.720
They said.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.480
It was an order.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.920
From Somdet Saenyakon.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.360
Phai! Phai!

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.480
Phai!

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.720
They sent soldiers to kill me.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.520
But these villagers
had to pay the price.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.440
That means…

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.480
Somdet Saenyakon
has been watching us all along.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.720
The volunteer force we have now.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.720
Lacks fighting skills.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.840
We must begin training at once.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.840
Not just the volunteers.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.760
But every one of you as well.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.400
You must master combat tactics too.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.040
Me too?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.160
No way!

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.600
Let me cook instead.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.360
Or work in the medics.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.240
Or even entertain the troops,
better than that.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.720
But holding swords or guns
to kill?

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.240
I can’t do that.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.680
You must.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.840
And everyone must too.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.520
If you all have some
fighting skills.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.600
You won’t have to rely
on me alone.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.680
I agree.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.800
At least we should
have the basics.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.400
Better than nothing at all.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.760
Like me, sir.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.920
I only know one neck chop move.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.160
Hmph. Before you get close enough.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.760
Your head would be cut off first.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.920
Exactly. You need sword training.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.520
I trained with my brother
long ago.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.680
I’d like to brush it up again.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.360
Just thinking about it sounds fun.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.360
Then tomorrow at dawn.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.760
All of you gather
at the palace yard.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.600
We’ll start by training
our bodies to endure.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.480
Respectful greetings, my Lord.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.080
Lord Kosol, sir.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.320
Somdet Saenyakon is here.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.000
How many came?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.320
Only two, sir.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.840
Somdet and one guard.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.920
The sentries at the city wall
reported.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.000
No troops followed behind.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.160
Strange. What game
are they playing?

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.680
If not to strike us down.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.720
Even if just two came.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.120
They still can’t be trusted.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.360
Chaiyached.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.320
Go prepare yourself well.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.680
I’m sure they came
because of you.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.160
Somdet Saenyakon.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.760
The Minister of War
requests audience.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.600
Respectful greetings, my Lord.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.160
It hasn’t been that long.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.680
But you’ve aged so much,
Count Somdet.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.800
I’ve heard Count Singha
has raised rebellion.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.280
It made me deeply worried
for Your Majesty.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.920
So I hurried here
to pay respects.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.120
Seeing Your Majesty
safe and sound.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.120
I feel greatly relieved.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.880
You truly are
a funny man.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.760
Isn’t Count Singha
your own man?

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.120
That’s true.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.800
He once worked with me.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.320
But his rebellion was done
on his own accord.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.000
And what about the soldiers
you sent to raid the village?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.960
How will you explain that?

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.640
I heard Your Majesty
would travel.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.560
So I dispatched soldiers
to guard you.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.640
But what happened after,
I had no knowledge of.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.120
Since those soldiers
haven’t returned.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.320
Finding this suspicious.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.400
I came to invite Your Majesty
back to the capital.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.600
So you deny
every accusation.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.480
Feign ignorance.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.800
And that clears you
of treason?

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.480
How convenient.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.600
Your Majesty.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.720
The one you should truly
be concerned about.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.880
Is this very Kosol.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.360
A traitor disguised
as a loyal brother.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.240
Have you forgotten, Your Majesty?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.840
How deeply he resents you.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.640
For seizing the throne
that was once his.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.120
He is the true traitor.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.000
No, you are the traitor.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.160
Did you think I never knew?

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.000
That you stirred unrest in the court.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.480
Turning brothers
against each other.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.520
So you could seize power
in the end.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.080
But I will be the one
to end this vile cycle.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.520
See, Your Majesty?

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.800
He just admitted
he’s the traitor.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.560
Enough.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.320
I don’t want to hear
that word again.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.400
I’ve heard it all my life
and I’m sick of it.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.000
False accusations of treason,
over and over.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.360
Pretending to care for me.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.120
But only for your own gain.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.200
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.320
I never intended
to anger you.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.200
In this kingdom,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.840
no one is more loyal
to Your Majesty than I.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.640
Please return to the capital
with me, Your Majesty.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.360
It is dangerous
to remain here.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.600
I will personally guard
Your Majesty’s safety.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.160
You wish for me to return?

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.480
Very well, I will return.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.120
But Brother Kosol
shall return with me.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.160
And you must restore
his noble title.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.440
What say you?

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.520
That would be most improper,
Your Majesty.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.760
If you do so,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.160
it would defy the will
of the late king.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.240
Your own father,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.280
who stripped Kosol of rank
and made him common.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.840
Will you serve the present king,
or the late one?

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.360
If you choose the late,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.000
I shall send you to him
this very instant.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.400
Thank you, Count Somdet,
for your concern.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.680
But I am well here
with my brother.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.520
If you have no more business,
you may leave.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.160
Once you return to the capital,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.760
sound the war drums at once.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.120
Yes, my Lord.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.120
Now you must all train
for battle in earnest.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.040
For Somdet will march
his army soon enough.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.480
As the Art of War
by Sun Wu says,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.480
Know the enemy, know yourself.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.160
A hundred battles,
a hundred victories.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.360
The capital’s soldiers
outnumber us.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.240
But their hearts are weaker.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.560
Because they never wished
to fight at all.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.120
They were conscripted.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.920
Our forces may be fewer.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.960
But every one of us fights

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.880
for our own freedom.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.360
We’ll divide into units,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.240
each with clear duties.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.600
But we’re already few in number.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.120
Won’t dividing us further

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.960
make us even weaker?

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.160
I agree with Banjong on this.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.200
Everyone has different strengths.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.360
We’re not all the same.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.920
And what do you know of war,
Worradej?

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.720
To dare voice an opinion?

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.840
Then I’ll do it.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.800
I’ll divide us by personality.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.760
Starting with Jade, you’re the tank.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.000
Your Majesty, you’re the mage.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.240
Kosol, you’re the assassin.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.240
Banjong, you’re the carry.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.000
The rest of you are fighters.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.080
And I’ll be support.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.040
What exactly
are you implying here?

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.600
Explain yourself.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.360
What are those strange terms
you keep saying?

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.840
Then listen closely, everyone.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.080
Starting with Jade as the tank.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.240
You’re the frontline fighter.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.440
His Majesty is the mage.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.040
Staying in the middle
to support all sides.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.560
Kosol is the assassin.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
He must find a way

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.000
to slip in and slay Somdet.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.800
Guard your sword well.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.520
Or you’ll lose your life easily.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.040
Better guard your cheeks too.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.080
Or you’ll get kissed easily as well.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.240
Banjong is the carry.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.640
The long-range attacker.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.800
Wow, just a bit more!

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.120
I’ll train till I shoot
like Banjong.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.520
Worradej.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.920
Aren’t you shooting?

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.480
I thought I was, Your Majesty.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.960
But why are there no holes?

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.720
Because you missed, that’s why.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.720
Worradej.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.520
I’ll teach you.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.040
You must stand firm first.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.040
And then what, Banjong?

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.640
Raise your hands like this.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.160
And I’ll be support.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.920
The big picture, looking pretty.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.400
Stay calm, Your Majesty.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.640
I’ll play the mage role anyway.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.240
You can’t stop me, brother.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.800
Why can’t I stop you?

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.600
I’m your elder brother.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.280
I forbid you to play it.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.000
I can wield a sword
and shoot a gun.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.320
Why won’t you let me take
an attack position?

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.960
Because you’re still young.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.760
But I’m already eighteen.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.360
When you were my age,

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.920
you went with Father
to crush rebellions.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.080
So why stop me now?

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.760
Because we’re not the same.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.320
If I let you fight,

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.960
you’ll only die in vain.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.160
Worse, you could be
a burden to others.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.240
I order you to stay put.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.080
Do not leave until this war ends.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.000
Your Majesty.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.800
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.120
Enough, Your Majesty.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.440
That’s something I could never bear.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.639
Your Majesty.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.679
Please calm your heart first.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:59.320
Lord Kosol forbade you only

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.480
because he worries for you.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.120
I’m glad he cares for me.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.440
But I’m also hurt

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.800
that he doesn’t trust my ability.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.600
Do you know?

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.880
Do you know what my name,
Chaiyached, means?

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.360
I do not, Your Majesty.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.520
“Chai” means one who is better.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.360
And “Ched” means the very best.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.880
Ched.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.520
The finest of all.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.000
I am Father’s youngest son.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.640
Mother wanted me to surpass
all my brothers.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.880
So she gave me this name.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.600
But in truth,

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.720
my name carries another meaning.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.200
“Chai” means victory.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.560
“Ched” means elder brother.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.840
Which can mean,

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.000
One who triumphs over his brother.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.200
But I never wished to be that.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.720
I never wished to stand above anyone.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.280
Sometimes I long for a simple name like yours.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.720
Jade.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.480
Is your name spelled with “D” at the end?

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.400
I would not know, Your Majesty.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.480
I cannot read or write.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.040
In truth,

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.920
my name is “Jiad,” Your Majesty.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.280
In my village tongue

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.680
it means “to share.”

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.840
But when the officials recorded slaves,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.440
my parents’ speech was not so clear.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.160
So they wrote it down as “Jade.”

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.720
That’s good.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.080
“Ched” and “Jiad” sound alike.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.200
So we can be a pair.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.560
A foreign slave like me

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.320
cannot grow close to a king like you, Sire.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.520
The curse would fall upon me.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.360
But if one day

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.440
I am no longer king,

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.440
then we can be close, can we not?

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.000
And no curse will come upon you.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.800
Your Majesty’s question is hard to answer.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.840
I truly don’t know how to reply, Sire.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.880
Banjong, I feel oddly confident.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.920
This time I’ll surely hit the mark.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.960
Mm.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.000
That split second when the sight aligns…

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.360
That’s the moment.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.600
Fire.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.600
Much better, Worradej.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.440
Just a bit more practice.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.040
Ugh, I’m done.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.960
At this rate, even lifetimes of training
won’t make me hit.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.920
I’d rather switch to another unit.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.040
Calm down.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.800
We still have time.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.200
Before Somdet’s army arrives,

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.280
we can keep training steadily.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.560
I’ll guide your hand until you shoot true.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.080
Mm, all right then.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.760
If the teacher won’t give up,

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.280
the student won’t quit.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.880
- Mm.
- Let’s try again.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.240
Come.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.840
Don’t forget what I taught you.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.240
Keep your back straight.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.160
Spread your legs.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.200
Focus.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.680
Stay mindful.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.640
Be steady.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.760
- Fire.
- Training’s over.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.880
Hey.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.240
What are you doing, Kosol?

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.040
What if I panicked, swung my gun,
and shot you dead?

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.680
Even if you fired a hundred more times,
I’d bet you’d never hit me.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.320
With Banjong as your teacher,

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.040
you’ll never shoot straight.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.120
Insult me if you want,

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.720
but don’t you dare insult
my student, Worradej.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.800
Worradej.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.760
Ignore the crows cawing,
the dogs and cats barking.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.840
Just listen to me.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.960
Trust me, one day you’ll hit the mark.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.640
Come on, let’s keep training.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.440
Banjong, I think…

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.520
Maybe we should call it a day.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.840
We’ll pick it up again tomorrow.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.600
Uh…

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.200
Come on, back to the quarters.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.800
It’s dinner time.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.800
Banjong.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.360
Sorry.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.480
I only set the table for two.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.840
Didn’t save you a spot.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.040
Banjong, dinner’s ready.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.800
Come on, let’s eat.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.080
You eat first.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.400
I’m not hungry.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.840
How can you not be?

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.040
You trained all day with swords and guns.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.120
Hey, I made fermented fish dip,
your favorite.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.720
If you don’t eat, I’ll be so upset.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.800
What’s wrong?

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.120
You look like you just got dumped.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.080
No, I didn’t.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.960
Why the deep voice then?

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.760
I didn’t say you actually got dumped.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.000
I just meant you look like someone who did.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.560
Wait.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.160
Did you really get dumped?

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.640
Come on, tell me.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.320
I said no.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.720
Stop pestering me.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.320
That confirms it.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.040
The way you’re yelling,
totally heartbroken.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.400
Nah.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.680
Worradej hasn’t rejected me yet.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.280
So I’m not heartbroken.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.920
You still haven’t given up on Worradej?

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.000
I don’t get what’s so special about him.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.880
When you like someone,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.480
it doesn’t matter.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.120
Whether they’re good or not.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.760
Like means like.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.600
And I really like him.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.480
- Stay out of it.
- I can’t.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.640
I don’t want him as my sister-in-law.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.640
I’ll pray day and night

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.720
that you get dumped by Worradej.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.280
If I get dumped,

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.120
then you’ll get dumped too.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.160
Because Worradej will choose Kosol.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.360
What? No way.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.120
Okay fine, I’ll change it.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.720
I’ll pray that your wish comes true.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.880
No, no!

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.240
I don’t want anyone to end up with Worradej.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.640
If you want Kosol,

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.600
you need to help me get Worradej.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.720
No way.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.440
Forget it, I’ll pass.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.200
Pandao

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.760
You have to help me.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.280
There’s no other choice.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.960
I order you right here, Banjong,

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.680
stay away from my Worradej forever.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.000
Thunder cracks loud, fire of guns,

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.240
a raging war inside my chest.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.440
Fighting with all my heart, two battles,

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.600
love and war colliding,

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.400
yet I fear nothing.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.840
Could we really be together,

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.560
like in the verses of a poem?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.200
The Count’s army is coming.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.240
We have one hour to prepare.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.920
Everyone, to your units and follow the plan.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.520
When their troops arrive,

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.080
we’ll leave the gates open.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.520
Lure them inside the city,

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.040
then it’ll be easier to strike.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.040
Surrender now,

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.800
and I’ll spare your lives.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.120
As for me,

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.960
I’ll take down the Count myself.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.240
Banjong!

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.560
Banjong!

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.440
Would you dance with me?

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.360
With pleasure, my lord.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.960
(They’re really practicing hard.)

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.200
(Perfect teamwork.)

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.440
You’re stars, kids.
(Keep it cool, kids.)

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.080
Cut!

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.360
So much sweat.
(All that energy.)

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.320
Get ready.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.680
See? You’ll never forget it now.
(It’ll stick forever.)

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.000
Never forget.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.200
(The Count’s body aches all over.)
