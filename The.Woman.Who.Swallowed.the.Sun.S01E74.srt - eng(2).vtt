00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.640
(Episode 74)

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.620
Why is he putting on this whole show?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.890
There has to be a reason.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.660
In that case, Min Doo Sik,
you've set up a trap...

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.400
and are waiting for
anyone to fall into it.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.800
But why?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.040
We have to hurry.
We can't put this off any longer.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.410
We need to move him to a nursing home
or another facility right away.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.180
What if the chairman
has a moment of clarity...

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.810
Do you really think that's possible?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.650
It's not completely out of the question.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.780
That's what they say about
dementia patients.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.680
A full recovery is unlikely,
but they can have periods of improvement.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.160
If by some miracle his condition improves
and he has a moment of clarity...

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.090
Even if he does,
he can't possibly run the company.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.460
My point is,
during one of those lucid moments,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.900
if he changes his will,
then it's all over for us.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.400
Change his will?

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.040
What if the person by his side,
during one of those lucid moments,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.210
convinces him to change
the will in their favor?

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.740
And you're saying that person is Lucia?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.620
What are you two doing
in the chairman's office while he's out?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.720
Give me those.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.890
I'll review and take care of them.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.350
Who do you think you are?

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820
Fine. Wait for the chairman
to approve them, then.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.660
You think this is your chance
now that Dad's like this?

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.000
So you two are plotting to take over
the chairman's office by camping out here.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.400
And what if we are?

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.240
Should we explain why we're doing this?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
Lawyer Kim.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.940
The term "legally incompetent" has been
obsolete for a long time.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.280
To be precise, we file a petition
with the Family Court...

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.910
to begin adult guardianship proceedings,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.450
which will restrict
the chairman's legal rights.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.150
Of course, with an illness like dementia,
we have no other choice.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.020
As the lawyer, I will lead this process.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.020
And as for...

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.890
the chairman's legal guardian,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.960
I still believe CEO Min
is the most suitable candidate.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.630
You two make quite a team.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.570
What would you two have done
if Dad hadn't gotten dementia?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.070
So you're using this as an excuse
to take over as chairman?

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.010
- Says who?
- It's an unavoidable decision.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.880
Do you still not understand
what's happening?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.490
(Director Min Soo Jung)

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.860
At this rate, is Min Kyung Chae going
to really become the chairman?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.130
No way!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.840
Director Oh, I need to see you.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.370
Is your prior engagement more important
than this?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.780
I'm calling you because this is important!

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.880
Is that really true?

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.550
The chairman doesn't have dementia?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.180
It is. I couldn't believe it myself.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.020
But what on earth could be the reason?

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.860
I'd understand if he'd try to hide it
if he had dementia,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.220
but why fake it when he's perfectly fine?

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.430
That's what I can't figure out.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.260
A man like him always has a clear motive
for his actions.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.270
So his doctor must be in on it, too.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.040
That's what Lucia said.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.470
She said the doctor and Min Doo Sik
go way back,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.270
so he wouldn't tell her the truth.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.640
Considering he even deceived CEO Min,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.580
don't you think he's testing his children?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.280
That could be it.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.590
He needs to see which of them is worthy...

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.420
before he hands over his position.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.130
But he's been pushing for CEO Min
as his successor all this time.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.330
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.630
With the whole marriage to Lucia,
Min Kyung Chae went way too far.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.100
She even orchestrated a kidnapping.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.400
And he knows about Soo Jung's true mother,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.010
so he must have been disgusted with her.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.810
But would he really go that far
just to test his children?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.910
Maybe, but...

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.680
I have a feeling...

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.490
that's not the whole story.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.950
What?

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.620
Not the whole story?

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.230
The person Chairman Min Doo Sik
really wants to test...

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.400
is someone else.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800
Who?

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.570
Don't tell me... Lucia?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.100
That's why you have to be careful
not to fall for it.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.910
Why would he suspect you again?

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.680
I thought all that was over.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.650
Now that I think about it,
I did give him a reason to be suspicious.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.150
What was it?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.150
The contract for Tae Kyung's parents.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.220
The one Min Doo Sik tried to steal?
What about it?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.790
I got caught secretly looking at it
that night.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.930
What are you looking at?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.930
Why did you open that?
You have no business looking in there.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.900
Oh, it's nothing.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.840
I was looking for your medicine
and was just wondering what this was.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.840
Why are you awake?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.050
He moved the contract, which means
it must have been bothering him.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.750
I was wondering why he didn't press me
about it back then.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.590
So that's why that scoundrel
is testing you.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.520
He was so suspicious of you
before the wedding.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.690
He hasn't changed at all.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.230
Now that I know what he's up to,
I won't fall for it.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.800
If anything, he's the one who gets played.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.230
Still, I have to be careful.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.370
If he'd go as far as faking dementia,
it means there's nothing he wouldn't do.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.840
This might actually be
an opportunity for us...

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.140
if I can make him disappointed
in his own children...

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.180
and get him to rely on me.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.090
Is there anything you need?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.060
There's something I want to tell you,
Chairman.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.740
Of course, you probably won't
understand me,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.410
but I want to say it anyway.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.350
It breaks my heart that you've fallen ill.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.750
Even so,

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.380
I'm truly happy being here...

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.550
by your side.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.760
I pray for you
to have a miraculous recovery,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.090
but even if you don't,
it doesn't matter to me.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.060
It doesn't matter to me
what condition you're in.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.600
But that doesn't mean I'm giving up.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.270
From now on,

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.040
I will do anything and everything for you.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.710
I'll hold a 100-day prayer
for your recovery,

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.150
and I'll cook you all the foods
said to be good for you.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.620
No matter what your children say,
I'll stay by your side until the end.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.460
I'll hold on,
even if they try to push me out.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.030
I'm going to take care of you.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.330
I'm not greedy.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.670
There's nothing I want.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.810
When I signed the share waiver agreement,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.280
do you know what I was thinking?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.980
"All I need is you, Chairman."

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.490
That's what I truly felt.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.490
That feeling...

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.990
hasn't changed one bit.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.440
So you're saying
Lawyer Kim Sun Jae found out everything?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.280
I told the accounting
and finance teams to keep quiet.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.410
What do we do now?

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.150
There's nothing we can do.
Lawyer Kim must have inside sources, too.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.950
Now that they know you requested
and received the files,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.250
his side won't just stand by.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.320
It doesn't matter.
They weren't confidential documents,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.460
and I obtained them through
the proper channels.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.930
So I don't need to worry?

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:12.800
Don't give it another thought.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.130
Okay.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.010
So he's your mole.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.410
Watch it. What do you mean by "mole?"

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.850
And you call yourself a lawyer.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.850
- Is "your lackey" better, then?
- Unbelievable.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.990
I don't know what makes you so confident
digging into my past,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.360
but there's nothing to find,
so stop wasting your time.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.690
We'll only know if there's anything there
once we actually start looking, right?

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.760
Borrowed-name accounts, nominee stocks,
shell companies, a secret ledger...

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.270
It's common practice to hide
and launder the chairman's dirty money.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.710
Usually, the right-hand man handles that.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.440
But here's the problem.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.410
When the right-hand man acts loyal,
he deceives him behind his back...

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.810
and starts siphoning money for himself.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.480
There are rotten people like that.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.450
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you accusing me of using double books?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.260
I never specifically mentioned you,
Lawyer Kim.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.360
You have some nerve saying such nonsense,
but if you keep this up...

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.270
Wait. No way.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.170
- Don't tell me you're...
- Go on.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.570
What is it?

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.570
Why stop mid-sentence?

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.380
No, it's nothing.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.380
What is it?

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.810
I'm outside your house, so come out.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.980
Are you crazy?

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.610
What do you think you're doing,
showing up here like this?

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.420
It'll just take a minute.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.120
You'd better come out.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.790
Or else I'll tell Chairman Min everything
about us.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.060
What's the point of telling a man
who's lost his mind?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.400
Even if he's not all there,
he won't like hearing that.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.760
So come out while I'm still asking nicely.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.510
I can't believe you came here
to cause a scene.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.910
You think I wanted to come here?
I came here to confirm something.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.450
Confirm what?
What is there for us to confirm?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.320
I'm going to ask you point-blank.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.790
The ledger you stole from me...

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.090
Did you really give it to Moon Tae Kyung?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.290
- I don't have to answer that.
- Answer me!

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.630
Why? Is he blackmailing you with it?

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.730
So you really did give it to him.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.170
How could you do this to me?
How could you?

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.010
What are you talking about?

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.310
That jerk is blackmailing me
with it right now!

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.250
So you got scared of his threats
and came running to me?

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.250
Scared? What's there to be scared of?

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.480
You two have it all wrong.
That ledger's only useful if he's lucid.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.620
Right now, he's just a senile old man.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.320
Do you think that threat will work?

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.720
Then you've got nothing to worry about.
So why are you here?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.490
I'm here to show you
what a stupid mistake you've made.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.200
I was just going to get
Moon Tae Kyung fired and be done with it.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.130
But not anymore.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.130
Now I'm going to finish that jerk.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.300
And as for you,

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.740
I'll make sure you waste your entire life
as a nursemaid to that senile old man.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.280
Just you watch.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.450
What's gotten into him?

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.090
Here, let me. I'll do it.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.210
You have to get better.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.810
Okay?

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.980
I'll make you yourself again
no matter what it takes.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
You'll see.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.630
(Mingang Distribution)

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.090
There's no reason to wait. Let's act now.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.600
Are you talking about
what to do with my father?

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.600
We've done enough preparation.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.400
If we wait, things could go wrong.
Let's get it over with this weekend.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.070
I'll call the nursing home
and have them send people over that day.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.370
Speaking of which,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.780
it looks like Director Min
has a meeting with Director Oh that day.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.580
Soo Jung is meeting with Director Oh?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.620
It's obvious why.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.480
She's probably being told
to win over the board members...

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.220
whose support you need for the chair.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.090
She'll always be a thorn in my side.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.460
That's why you need to get rid...

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.030
of your sister as soon as
you become the chairman.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.730
- I will.
- And Ji Seop, too.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.030
He's too incompetent to be of any use,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.900
but he could easily become a liability
if he chose to.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.640
- And finally, as for Se Ri...
- Leave Se Ri out of this.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.380
Don't lay a finger on her.
She can't get hurt.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.250
I won't stand for it.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.680
Understood.
Then we need to get everyone else out...

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.120
so the chairman will be
the only one left at home.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.060
Take Se Ri and go somewhere
for the weekend.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.060
This weekend?

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.700
I'll have Driver Kim take you.
Go somewhere far.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.770
How about the holiday home in Yangpyeong?

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.340
Why all of a sudden?

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.970
Don't ask why.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.240
Just make sure Se Ri
doesn't get suspicious.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.910
Just act natural
and get her out of the house.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.790
Oh my, what's this?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.960
Sun Jae sent us tickets
for a show this weekend.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360
What kind of show?

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.430
A classical concert.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.000
Premium seats, too.
These tickets must have been expensive.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.330
He sent two tickets for us to go together.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.100
Why all of a sudden?
What's gotten into him?

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.910
I know, right? I wonder what's going on.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.980
Speak of the devil.
We were just talking about you.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.050
What's with you? What's gotten into you?

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.790
Since when have you been so
thoughtful to us?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.590
What?

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:44.990
You made a reservation where?

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.790
That place is
a globally acclaimed restaurant.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.200
You did?

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.030
I don't know what you're up to,
but thanks anyway.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.170
- Was that Sun Jae?
- Yes.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.640
He also booked a restaurant for us
so we could have dinner after the show.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.670
He did?

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.320
Aren't you even worried
about the chairman?

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.320
How can you not even check on him once?

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.320
I can come up with excuses
to get the family out of the house,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.930
but the problem is how to get Lucia
away from my father.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.800
Don't worry about her.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.830
I'll take care of it.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.600
Do you have a plan?

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.840
I'll make sure she has no choice
but to leave the house.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.810
Because I know her very well.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.840
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.310
It's nothing.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.650
How's my father doing?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.620
If you're so worried, you should check
on him at least once a day.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.020
I will.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.620
He's sleeping now, isn't he?

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.650
Too bad. I guess I'll start tomorrow.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.100
If that creep Kim Sun Jae finds out
you're investigating him,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.700
he won't just let it slide.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.010
He probably sees the chairman's dementia
as an opportunity.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.950
He'll think the chairman forgot the ledger
along with his other memories.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.480
That's what they call
being too clever for your own good.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.350
When he finds out the chairman...

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.390
doesn't actually have dementia,
what's he going to do then?

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.720
But...

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.230
it's a little strange that CEO Min
is still so quiet.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.860
I agree. It's about time she made a move.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.870
With Kim Sun Jae egging her on,
she won't stay quiet for long.

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.940
She'll probably make her move soon.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.270
Look at everyone enjoying the weekend,

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.240
but my poor Ja Kyung is
with her father-in-law,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.110
unable to even visit her own dad.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.150
Actually, I heard Ja Kyung is out
with Ji Seop.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.120
Really? Then who's with her father-in-law?

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.490
I heard his new young wife, Lucia,
is taking great care of him.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.390
She's doing what his kids couldn't.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.360
She deserves a medal for her devotion.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.830
Goodness, Ja Kyung's father-in-law really
hit the jackpot with his wife in old age.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.130
What good is hitting the jackpot
when he's completely lost his marbles...

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.630
and just cooped up in that house?

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.530
But who knows?
Maybe with his young wife's devoted care,

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.670
he might suddenly snap out of it.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.670
Honey, what would you do
if I got dementia like him?

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.580
Would you stay by my side
and take care of me like she does?

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.950
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.020
Are you crazy? What's to like?

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.820
If you get dementia, we're through.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.890
So you'd better keep your wits about you,
Yang Mal Sook.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.560
What can I expect from you, Oh Pan Sool?

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.790
You don't have a humane bone in your body.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.860
Don't worry about my sanity.
Worry about your own.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.170
The second you lose your mind,
I'm out of here.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.870
You're a real piece of work.
Looks like the feeling's mutual.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.740
Exactly. Since we can't trust each other,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.510
let's just make sure we both stay sane...

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.610
- and see who lasts longer.
- Hey, let go of me!

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.910
Come on now.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.980
I told you I didn't want to go.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.220
Why the sudden trip to the holiday home?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.390
It'll be nice to get some fresh air
for a change.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.760
If we go, the whole family should go.
What fun is it with just the two of us?

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.160
We can have a nice, private chat
and have a barbecue.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.870
Just the two of us? That's so weird.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.730
But why there, all of a sudden?

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.570
Just because.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.440
- Let's just go, eat, and come back.
- We're staying for dinner?

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.640
Then no one will be home.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.380
Come on, get ready. Okay? Get up.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.150
All right, great.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.920
What? Wait, is that really true?

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.790
The chairman really has dementia?

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.790
So what's going to happen
to the chairman now?

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.290
He can't possibly stay on as chairman.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.700
Then what about you?

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.600
My sister sees me as a thorn in her side.
You think she'll just let me be?

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:50.970
Hold on. If that's the case,

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.440
then I won't be safe either,
since I'm on your side.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.610
Exactly.
We're all here to figure out our survival.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.940
So from now on,
it's all up to you, Director Oh.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.780
Do I even have that kind of power?

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.420
Then what are you suggesting?

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.590
If Father steps down
and my sister becomes acting chairman,

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.520
it's over for both of us, Director Oh.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.460
Do you want to just let it end like this?

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.340
Look at the time.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.810
You must be hungry.
I'll have them set up lunch.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.410
Manager Gong!

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.450
Manager Gong.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.650
Just a moment.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.660
Manager Gong.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.160
Manager Gong?

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.450
Se Ri.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.120
Se Ri's not here either.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:15.790
Where did they go?

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.890
The person you called is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.300
The family's all gone now.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.770
It's just the chairman and Lucia at home.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.370
What about the people
from the nursing home?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.040
They're on standby.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.840
The problem is how to lure that woman
out of the house.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.350
I told you, I'll take care of that.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.320
It's me. Let's start.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.020
What's this?

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.390
Hello?

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.230
This is the Cheonguk Columbarium.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.100
Cheonguk Columbarium?
That's where Mi So is.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.770
What's this about?

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.640
We're calling to inform you of a fire
at the columbarium.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.110
A fire?

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.010
Is Mi So okay?

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.650
The A-wing on the second floor
was completely destroyed in the fire.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.720
We're trying to contact all families
as quickly as possible.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.020
We're going to need you to come down here.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.630
How on earth did you do that?

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.870
I've never seen Lucia that frantic before.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.940
Where is she going in such a rush,
leaving Father home all alone?

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.740
I have my ways.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.180
Shall we make our move, then?

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.090
Now I'm going to do something to you,
Father.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.630
You might see it as something terrible.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.000
But what can I do?

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.000
This is our fate.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.240
Perhaps today...

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.540
will be the last day of our bond
as father and daughter.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.850
They say when a lion grows old and sick,
it leaves the pride.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.550
So it doesn't show any weakness.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.020
Because in the wild,
the weak are targets for attack.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.160
It hides itself to avoid being attacked.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.530
You should have done the same, Father.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.200
Now that you're so powerless and weak,
how could I possibly not attack you?

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.470
Did you know?

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.640
Just as there cannot be two suns
in the sky,

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.410
Mingang Distribution cannot have
two masters.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.280
Your time is over, Father.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.550
From now on,
the age of Min Kyung Chae begins.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.550
Once you leave this house today,

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.890
you will never come back.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.290
Because that nursing home
will be your grave.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.260
You should've known when to quit.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.300
If you'd made me chairman sooner,
none of this would have happened.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.570
You may have created Mingang,
but I'm the one who built it up.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.010
No matter what anyone says,
I'm the new owner of Mingang Distribution!

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.310
Please, check on Mi So for me.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.280
What's wrong with your voice?
And what's this about Mi So?

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.390
I got a call from the columbarium.
They said her urn might've been damaged.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.950
What? When?

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.620
I don't know the details.
I was too flustered to ask.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:51.260
But getting this call right now
feels suspicious.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.900
What is it that's bothering you?

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.700
It might be a coincidence,
but no one's home right now.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.130
I feel uneasy about leaving Chairman Min
all by himself.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.140
Can you check the columbarium for me?
I think I need to head back home.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:04.310
All right, got it.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.610
I'm sure Mi So is fine.
I'll look into it and call you back.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.380
But why now of all times?

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.550
No one's home,
and they lured Lucia out of the house?

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.460
Min Doo Sik is there all alone...

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.230
Don't tell me...

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.840
Yes...

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.070
There's something I'd like
to discuss with you.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.510
You're here at the perfect time.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:42.280
Lucia just got a call
from Mi So's columbarium,

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.680
and something seems very off.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.720
Was there a fire last night
at the Cheonguk Columbarium in Paju?

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.690
No, I don't think so.
I haven't heard any news about a fire.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.330
Okay, I'll have Tae Joo check
if there was a fire at the columbarium.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.200
You need to go to Chairman Min's house.
There's no one else there.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.830
- I have a bad feeling.
- No one's there?

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.570
Don't tell me...

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.470
CEO Min Kyung Chae?

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280
What's wrong?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.880
Are you scared,
knowing you're about to be locked away?

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.320
But why do I find this so satisfying?

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.690
I guess you never imagined
it would end like this, did you, Father?

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.730
Is that why you brutally killed Ho Se,
not knowing this would happen?

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.830
How could you touch my man
without saying a single word to me?

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.840
Who do you think you are?

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.840
Now you have to pay the price.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.150
And if you think someone
will come to save you, dream on.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.350
You think Lucia will come running
to your rescue?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.580
She won't.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.720
That woman is never coming.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:02.530
Come in.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.770
Get off me!

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.200
Let go of me, you jerks!
Do you have any idea who I am?

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.870
Let go! I said, let go!
What do you think you're doing?

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.810
Do you think I'm going to let you
get away with this?

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.780
There's nothing wrong with me!

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.930
