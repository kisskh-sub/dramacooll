00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.430
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.140
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.570
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.580
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.960
(My Youth)

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.489
(Episode 6)

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.529
Hey.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.429
Hey, are you really sure I don't have to go?

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.629
There's no reason for you to come.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.770
All you'd do is just grab the contract anyway.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.700
I'll just sign it on the spot.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.799
All right, got it. Call me.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.439
Didn't his career end after some fraud scandal?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.639
Really?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.909
He didn't seem like the type to scam people.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.579
He seemed like such a nice person.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.749
You're so hopelessly naive.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.150
Just look up "Sunwoo Hae fraud case."

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.320
No, you jerk. Darn it.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.130
Oh, that's right.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.159
Did they take down that old video?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.399
I saw it, you know. The kid didn't even cry. Stone-cold.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.129
Yes, but even that seemed like an act to me.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.940
Gives you the creeps, doesn't it?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.510
He has to know, right? That he's why his mom died.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.140
It's all in the past. Just give it a rest.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.979
Why are you all stooping so low?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.679
You should focus on your own career instead of minding others' business.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.749
You can't even handle your one actress.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.989
- Why you little... - That's enough. Stop it.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.689
- I said stop! - Let me go.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.360
Knock it off!

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.059
Ouch!

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.790
What? Ouch!

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.659
What was that?

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.029
I never had a sponsor.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.200
And the fraud was committed by the jerks using my name.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.370
And I'm the one who worked to pay for it.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.940
And my mom... I...

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.540
I know darn well I'm the reason she's dead.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.710
Get your hands off her, you punk.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.760
Let's go.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.069
What are you doing here?

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.600
Geon No said he was coming.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.410
You...

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.240
You heard everything, didn't you? From the start?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.810
If you heard all that, then why...

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.549
Why would you just stand there and listen?

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.590
From now on, just ignore anything you hear about me.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.560
Don't waste your energy on pointless things.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.790
Pointless?

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.289
How could you say that's pointless?

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.689
I mean, don't engage with every little thing.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.730
People are going to talk no matter what.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.429
What good will it do for you to get down in the mud with them?

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.929
Well, I'm getting in the mud.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.400
And if I'm in, I'll fight until I'm black and blue. Got a problem?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.609
Why do I feel like I'm the only one overreacting?

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.010
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.279
What, should I act happy about it?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.480
Seeing you get insulted for no cause and treated so horribly...

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.950
The woman I like is going through this because of me.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.050
Because I've seen how you've lived, and I know you.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.060
You've worked so hard.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.730
I just hated seeing you humiliated like that.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.030
What is all this commotion?

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.470
Our guests will be here any minute. What in the world is going on?

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.070
Explain.

00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:54.739
Dong Jun grabbed Je Yeon's collar,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.239
and that's when Sunwoo Hae walked in.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.180
- Sunwoo Hae? - Yes.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.280
I can't believe them...

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.050
Sung Je Yeon.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.750
Han Dong Jun. You two...

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.060
I'm here for the publication rights.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.830
The original author's approval.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.760
You said you needed it.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.940
You were the representative?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.310
So that's why the name was...

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.610
That's impossible.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.009
That's right.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.280
I was the one using that name.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.990
Did you know?

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.130
That Sunwoo Hae is actually Jin Mu Yeong?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.730
Am I just supposed to stand here?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.070
Sorry things are a bit of a mess for your first visit.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.510
Why don't we talk in my office?

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.039
This way. I can show you...

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.040
The signature.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.310
Do I have to sign today?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.720
I'm not really in the mood.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.450
I'm not the one in a hurry.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.490
I think I'll head out for today.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.330
You're leaving?

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.030
The other party's name on the contract.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.330
Correct it before you leave.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.470
- Yes. - And the meeting date.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.940
Reschedule it for as soon as possible.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.740
You, just get out. I can't stand the sight of you.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.880
Sunwoo Hae!

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.990
I'm heading out.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.060
See you after your meeting.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.230
Gosh.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.960
You just suck the life out of me.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.030
Go on.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.280
Hey, are you okay?

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.150
I'm fine.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.250
Please, just go.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.260
(Jin Mu Yeong, Real name, Sunwoo Hae)

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.830
Are you sure you're okay?

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.430
Yes.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.739
Oh, you have a nosebleed.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.940
Oh, come on.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.980
I bet he was pretty upset earlier, too.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.049
It's not like I just stood by because I agreed.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.480
Since when are you so chummy with him?

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.350
Next time you see him, be sure to tell him that.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.690
To his face.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.180
You're still here?

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.689
The CEO didn't say anything else?

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.659
Let's talk on the way out.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.359
We have to reschedule the meeting.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.559
Hey, let me see. The spot where you...

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.960
Stop, I'm serious.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.700
It's so humiliating, for real.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Why?

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.900
What is?

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.300
Do you think I like being seen like that?

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.610
That I don't feel humiliated?

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.270
Getting grabbed by the collar and all.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.980
I was already upset, and then you had to start in on me.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.180
This is driving me nuts.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.390
You were really annoying.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.720
Pointless, you say?

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.230
Yes.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.860
Why are you laughing?

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.660
Why are you hugging me?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.130
Real smooth, aren't you?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.940
Hold still.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.220
Your face is so puffy, I could see it from a mile off.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.890
Here, hold this against it.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.160
Just stay still.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.760
No, I'll do it.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.530
All right.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.060
So, when do you want to have the meeting?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.999
If you can't come to the office, we can work with your schedule.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.229
- Just make sure you sign. - Don't worry, I'm going to.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.770
With that much money on the line?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.740
And while I'm at it...

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.239
I might make them sweat a little.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.310
You are something else.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.110
Hey! If you mess with them, I'm the one who gets burned!

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.079
- Hey! You... - What?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080
Hey, don't use your hands.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.989
Gosh.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.720
- No. It's fine. - Hold on.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.090
Yes. Here.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.730
Here.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.700
Stop treating me like a gorilla!

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.600
You know...

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.309
Wouldn't a gorilla be calmer than you?

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.640
You just couldn't resist, could you?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.110
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.080
So...

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.279
All that gossip from my co-workers.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.590
You're not going to keep dwelling on it, are you?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.490
Well, once the show airs,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.760
I figure that's how they'll talk.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.289
When I was a kid,

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.729
I'd get in trouble with my mom for secretly watching you on TV.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.799
What?

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.500
There have to be other people like me out there.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.440
You know something?

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.840
It's like you haven't changed at all, you know?

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.849
Still carrying that heavy bag,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.580
and how you charge head first into everything.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.819
You're living life on the straight and narrow.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.019
Exactly.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.090
I really am on the straight and narrow.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.230
It's the world that's crooked.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.660
So just keep doing what you did today.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.669
- Like what? - Clearing yourself of fake charges.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.500
And getting payback for me when I get hit.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.610
All right, let's try this again.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.010
Signal on.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.289
Check your side mirror.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.349
Okay.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.819
Oh, look, the car behind is waiting for you.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.119
- Okay, now. - Now?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.720
- Now? Right now? - Yes, now!

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.359
- Gosh! - Gosh!

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.099
Are you just going to drive straight forever?

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.029
We're going to end up on the freeway at this rate!

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.399
I can merge at the next opening.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.599
It's not like it's my last chance.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.339
Come on, I thought you signed up for driving school.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.710
If you're going to drive like that, go practice there!

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.879
Instead of working three jobs,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.149
focus on your driving!

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.410
Did it ever occur to you that you're the one distracting me?

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.020
Are you taking a bad day out on me or something?

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.250
You know what?

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.820
Don't even bother getting your license.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.759
I can't stand the thought of someone like you on the road.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.029
What do you mean, "someone like me?"

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.199
You can talk after you teach me properly!

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.499
How much better can I possibly teach you? Seriously!

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.370
Hey, eyes on the road! For crying out loud!

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.710
Hey, Son.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.210
This is kind of...

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.349
Why's he here again?

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.719
So, I heard you stopped by the house.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.820
Oh, for goodness' sake.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.490
Are you really becoming Seok Joo's little lackey?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.520
Seok Joo's a total weirdo, don't you think?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.960
Don't say that. Seok Joo's a nice guy.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.300
Hey, by any chance,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.130
- my old photo albums... - Yes?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.599
No, never mind. No way you'd have them.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.810
What are you talking about? I have all your old albums.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.210
Your mom treasured those things like they were sacred.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.410
I'll...

00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:22.810
Deliver them to me, or use a courier.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.750
I'll use a courier service.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.719
This thing... Would you look at this?

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.520
I'll send it by courier. Okay, bye!

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.990
Hi, I have a delivery.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.629
That'll be five dollars, please.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.700
Got some free time?

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.639
Didn't you say you were starting some publishing company or whatever?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.739
Well...

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.139
I just finished a deadline, so things are slow right now.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.610
That's not what I mean.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.649
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.310
This photo album...

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.889
So...

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.719
this album...

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.519
Even when I was really...

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.190
Even when I had nowhere to live and was scraping by, you know?

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.929
I left it with someone I trusted.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.400
I always made sure to get it back.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.500
These photos.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.099
These are irreplaceable moments.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.170
Right.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.540
I guess it was cheaper to get the album back than your kid.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.410
Listen, if Seok Joo bothers you again, you tell me.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.720
I'll go set him straight, you hear?

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.119
I'll go and teach him a lesson he won't forget.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.659
Just because he's her son... There's a limit to what I'll allow.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.790
I'm leaving!

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.490
Okay.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.959
So, no flower for me?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.030
Fine.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.030
I'm off.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.639
(Sunwoo Hae)

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.010
(Sunwoo Hae)

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.230
Where could Sung Je Yeon be?

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.610
Do you really...

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.839
have to get your license?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.610
We need to stop at a gas station on the way.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.180
He said to return it with a full tank of gas.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.550
I can't even get mad anymore.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.820
Where are we supposed to return it?

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.260
Aren't you cold?

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.730
Hey.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.629
How long have you been standing there?

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.229
Why are you here?

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.500
For a while now.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.969
It's just, you know...

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.369
My brother told me to return his car here.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.809
Though I have no idea where "here" is.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.650
Who are you? This is Nu Ri's house.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.809
Je Yeon.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.450
We need to have a little talk.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.289
- But, it's too risky here. - Risky?

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.950
Let's go somewhere less conspicuous.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.990
What? Wait. Where are you taking me?

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.630
You'll keep this a secret, right?

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.369
I'm telling you, he'll tear me to shreds.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.939
Is Sunwoo Hae the type of guy to make a fuss about someone dating?

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.739
He didn't even say anything about my grades being a mess.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.340
You think he'll just let this slide too?

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.279
I'm a little hesitant to say this, but...

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.349
if your grades are terrible and you're dating on top of that,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.919
isn't he the type to lump it all and blow up about everything?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.920
You don't sound very hesitant.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.590
Anyway...

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.159
- Who are you, really? - She and my brother are a thing.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.259
A "thing?"

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.589
Gosh, he's actually seeing someone?

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:55.659
A "thing..."

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.589
He's not really the type. I thought he'd call it a waste.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.699
Wait a minute.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.129
Did you just criticize my brother?

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.530
No, I respect him for being so thrifty.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.840
Hold on.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.510
It's nothing, really, but...

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.179
Here you go.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.540
Treat yourself to something nice.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:15.850
Thank you.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.479
When an adult gives you something...

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.189
My brother said to say, "Thank you" and accept it.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.490
You did the right thing.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.129
Lunch was good here, wasn't it?

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.190
Yes.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.229
Oh, thank you.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.430
Thank you for the meal.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.169
According to the contract, at the end of this month,

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.900
Your term is set to expire. You're aware of that, right?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.500
Yes.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.340
I...

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.979
In the garden you've so carefully tended,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.150
do I belong?

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.910
What could be the problem?

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.880
I've given it a lot of thought.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.650
You're the one who taught me all of these wonderful things.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.420
You've done so much for me and taught me everything, but...

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.490
I guess I just wasn't good enough.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.260
Well...

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.630
You've clearly given this a lot of thought, haven't you?

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.199
So...

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.069
are you in talks with any other agencies?

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.670
If not, I can make some calls for you.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.570
Oh, no, that's all right.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.280
Just you offering...

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:21.579
is enough. Thank you.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:22.580
All right.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.750
As for your next project...

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.120
it's an awkward time to be choosing one.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.349
You must've worn yourself out reading scripts for nothing.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.420
Not at all.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.560
Please give them my regrets.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.790
I will.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.370
Ever since you were this little,

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.470
I'd hug you when you cried, and comfort you and send you to shoots.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.510
There was a time I was more devoted to raising you than my own children.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.880
You've worked so hard all this time.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:57.950
Yes.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.180
You have, too.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.630
Oh my gosh.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.100
Hey, aren't you Tae Rin?

00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:15.899
I'm sorry, who...

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.240
What? You don't remember me?

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.809
I took such good care of you back in high school.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.479
Oh, are you Hye Bin?

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.679
Yes!

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.140
Gosh, what a surprise running into you.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.010
You're on social media, right?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.119
I recently started my own enzyme supplement business.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.320
We should go get a coffee or something.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.419
I'm so sorry,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.259
but let's do it next time. It'll be my treat.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.160
Oh, you're busy.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.059
Then again, even back in the day,

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.429
you were so busy you could hardly ever make it to school.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.500
No, it's not that.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.300
It's just the state I'm in right now...

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.400
Could you please let go?

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.340
Oh, my.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.970
Who made her cry?

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.340
It wasn't me.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.450
Hey, why are you making this so awkward for me?

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.820
No, I...

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.720
All right, that's enough.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.560
Pretend to wipe your tears and hide your face.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.960
You need to cry some more, don't you?

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.790
You can just go that way.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.900
What are you giving me now?

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.740
Coffee, cigarettes,

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.669
and a handkerchief.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.510
With all this, is he really not hitting on me?

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.070
Excuse me?

00:19:30.071 --> 00:19:31.880
I'd appreciate it if you just went on your way.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.879
No, I was just...

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.010
Gosh, this is so annoying.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.150
Hitting on you?

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.190
Me?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.930
What's with her? Why is she being so nosy?

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.060
Oh, right. My bag.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.400
My bag.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.340
Can I have it back, please?

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.709
Why do you keep crying?

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.739
What, you want me to think about it and get back to you?

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.279
About why I keep crying?

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280
Yes.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.950
Here's my business card.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.590
You can let me know when you have an answer.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.620
You're so weird.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.589
Look who's talking.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.859
Knock yourself out.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.859
That you went out of your way to follow me and say that...

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.160
is what's really weird.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.930
That day,

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.669
I thought we had a pretty good vibe on the rooftop.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.670
"We?"

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.040
"Good vibe?"

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.309
Just be straight with me.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.240
That way I'll know how to act around you.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.749
You left your bag behind, so I picked it up for you.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.979
And I'm offended you think I'm hitting on you.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.620
No, that's not what I meant by "be straight with me!"

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.820
Look,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.519
whenever a guy approaches me, I just assume he's hitting on me.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.929
I assume he has an ulterior motive.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.689
Sure, at first they say it's just kindness or goodwill.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.760
But in the end, they all want the same thing.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.570
Why would you be any different?

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.440
Seems like you're feeling a little better now.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.840
- That's a relief. - Hey!

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.639
Are you messing with me right now?

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.980
I'm not.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.079
Oh, so we're talking informally now?

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.549
You're so condescending.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.249
I mean, if you were just honest, it might at least be cute.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.479
Why do you keep upsetting me?

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.749
I'm already feeling down as it is!

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.920
Condescending...

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.589
If I did have ulterior motives...

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.659
If I were hitting on you, would you be less upset?

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.999
What, so if I wasn't upset,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.829
were you just going to say you had no ulterior motives?

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.469
Why are you twisting things?

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.429
No, I actually don't have any.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.799
If I did, I wouldn't be doing this either.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.999
No, my point is,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.339
why even ask if I'd be less upset?

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.939
You need to be less upset.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.939
You have to calm down for us to have a conversation.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.480
I was just trying to get you to calm down.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.550
Hey.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:58.660
You.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.020
If you fall for me, you're dead meat.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.560
What? As if I...

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.330
Why would I...

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.680
Oh, hey.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.079
- Hey. - Yes?

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.419
Does Mo Tae Rin come here often?

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.420
Oh, hey.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.050
Here.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.419
Take this back to your parents' place for me.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.829
Put it somewhere out of sight.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.960
(Sunwoo Hae)

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.030
So this was the favour you wanted to ask.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.500
Here.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.499
I went on a blind date,

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.040
and she gave me this. She said her hobby is pottery.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.970
A blind date?

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.509
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.550
- She made this? - She bought it.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.179
You can return the favour sometime. I'll be in touch.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.790
Hey, if this is about Mo Tae Rin, she doesn't come here often.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.120
That wasn't the favour I had in mind, though.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.590
I'm off.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.040
Hi, Bebop!

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.909
Hi, Beat!

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.210
Can you pay my taxi fare?

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.039
Seok Joo went that way. Go ask him to pay.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.780
What? When?

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.579
Is that what Kim Seok Joo said? That there was something between us?

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.089
Tell him he's dreaming!

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.650
I'd rather not have known.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.420
You go tell him yourself.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.889
Excuse me, you need to pay the fare.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.630
Oh, right. Just a second.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.799
Hey!

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.000
What are you doing? Hurry up.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.169
Seriously.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.940
What are you doing, just showing up here?

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.239
Keep the change.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.080
- All right, thank you. - Thank you.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.720
Are you even allowed to eat this?

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.560
I thought you were on a diet.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.500
Oh, the shoot's over. I'm jobless right now.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.529
But is the shop always this slow?

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.430
Well, since you're here, why don't you buy something?

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.100
Sung Je Yeon said you buy flowers all the time.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.009
You're right.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.140
She used to buy them for me most of the time.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.780
Why did I take it all for granted?

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.179
Wait, you talked about that with Je Yeon?

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.090
I've been walking on eggshells, I couldn't even reach her.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.890
Oh, Seok Joo gave me this.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.560
His blind date gave this to him. Here, have some more.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.359
Why are you telling me this?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.800
It's not like I'm telling you specifically.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.039
After all these years, the only thing I've improved at...

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.910
is reading people, not my acting.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.969
A blind date?

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.539
I can't speak for your acting,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.409
but you've surely gotten taller.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.179
Are you mocking me because I've never won an acting award?

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.519
Why would I bother to mock you? Do you have a victim complex?

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.919
What does a retiree know?

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.549
I've been acting for ten years longer than you have.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.149
Hey, I debuted first.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.219
Look at you, talking so casually to your senior.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.189
Aside from the legendary veterans, I'm basically the most senior actor.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.300
How should I address you then, my esteemed senior?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.099
You can talk down to me all you want.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.869
Just please buy some flowers, customer.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.870
How can you not buy a single thing? Unbelievable.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.080
Here.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.510
What?

00:25:42.511 --> 00:25:44.980
Give this back to Kim Seok Joo when he comes by.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.680
Oh, okay.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.920
What?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.899
What? Was I supposed to figure out a way to say no?

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.300
I don't know.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.300
I said I don't know either! Gosh!

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.440
I'm just so confused today.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.640
Can't you just go?

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.280
Seriously.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.110
Fine, I'll go.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.380
Can I borrow 50 dollars?

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.760
(Your checkup is scheduled on Wednesday)

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.600
Hey, what's with the face?

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.970
I said "borrow," not "have."

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:44.910
Welcome.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.409
- Oh, what's that? - Squid.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.310
- Thank you. Have a good day! - You too. Come again.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.110
Excuse me, how much is this?

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.680
Four for ten dollars.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.190
This is salty.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.460
Here, drink some water.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.170
Hey, what are you...

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.610
Take it easy today. Those tests were pretty strenuous.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.210
Okay, I will.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.720
Thank you.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.380
Thanks for everything.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.530
She's about to lose it.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.360
Here you are.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.530
Gosh.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.200
Got it!

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.200
Here you go.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.799
- Thank you. - Okay.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.040
Say thank you.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.369
Want some?

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.440
Can I?

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.079
It turned your teeth pink. Let me see.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080
Okay.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.350
Yes, they are.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.420
Sweet.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.190
Go right!

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.860
Watch out for the glass!

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.229
My hand is stuck! Gosh.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.329
Okay, I'm free. Seriously.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:14.600
What did you buy?

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:16.899
Wait a minute.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.900
What is it?

00:28:17.901 --> 00:28:19.369
Didn't you just hear something outside?

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:20.370
What sound?

00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:22.470
I thought your dad already passed by...

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.880
Get back! Hide!

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.180
Over there! Quick!

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:29.680
Hey, get down!

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.020
Quiet.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.919
Okay, the coast is clear. Let's go.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.019
Let's go.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.690
No footsteps. Quietly...

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:44.630
Over there, hurry up!

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.500
Oh, gosh.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.410
Gosh!

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:57.370
What?

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.040
(Sunwoo Hae)

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.650
What's this doing here?

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.240
What are you doing in the kid's room?

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:30.970
Well...

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.410
You scared me.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.979
You just got here?

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.779
We were supposed to get breakfast this morning, remember?

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.249
I'm starving.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.920
Okay, let me stash this real quick. Wait for me outside.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.919
All right. Hide it well and come on out.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.920
Okay.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.459
Gosh, that made me jump.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.759
I guess Mom's off work now.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.000
You really need to get your intel right.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.170
Seriously, what kind of company makes its CEO pull an all-nighter?

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.300
Hey! My hand.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.609
Just grab a bite and hit the sauna.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.810
Seriously!

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.709
If you ever put in the wrong address for a delivery again, I swear...

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.910
I love you, brother.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.019
Wait, why are we hiding again?

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.279
So what then?

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.450
Should we just march over and say hello?

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.960
- Just stay still. - Let's just stay put.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.689
By the way, what were you hiding earlier?

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.990
Oh, an old photo album.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.540
I was worried you'd be upset if you saw it...

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.040
I've been in a bad enough mood this whole time as it is.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.940
Because you don't like Hae's mom.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.810
Hae's mom's name was...

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.750
Mu Yeong, wasn't it? Jin Mu Yeong?

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.790
If only we hadn't gone to that backwater town back then,

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.390
my life never would have gotten tangled up with yours.

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.300
Are we really going to dredge up all this old stuff right now?

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:03.629
"Dredge up?"

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.939
The part where you dump women often and abandon your own kid?

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.539
We haven't even gotten to that part yet.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.839
Come on.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.510
That's pretty harsh for this early in the morning.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.080
When you say things like that, it's genuinely upsetting.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:17.879
It was a fated connection for its time.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.679
Oh, "a fated connection for its time?"

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.180
That's a fancy way to put it.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.249
Why didn't you wait for me back then?

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.719
Was Hae's mom that great?

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.819
Listen...

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.859
After you left for Seoul back then without a single word,

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.530
I had a really hard time, too.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:32.899
I couldn't just wait for you forever...

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.600
and waste away in that seaside town.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.400
But I came back to you in the end, didn't I?

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.869
You told me to come back if I was ever unhappy, so I did.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:41.870
Come back?

00:31:41.871 --> 00:31:43.910
You never came back after what happened to his mother!

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.810
Oh, for goodness' sake.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.520
You really don't hold anything back, do you?

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.390
Look, that was just a tragedy.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.390
I needed comfort.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.520
And you're not that kind of person for me.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:05.700
Then what am I to you?

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.600
What exactly am I to you?

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.730
Do you even love me at all?

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.070
I wouldn't be here if I didn't love you.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.340
So why on earth am I still in love with you?

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.270
Sometimes I just don't get it.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.510
You still let your emotions get the best of you around me.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.820
You just start yelling.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.020
Being with me takes you back to when you were young, doesn't it?

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.220
Back when we were passionate.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.230
You still haven't moved on from that time.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.500
I'm going to stay somewhere else for a while.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:43.930
Get back here!

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.070
Hey, Sunwoo Chan!

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.810
I'll finish moving this.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.140
Go on inside.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.120
You know...

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.419
He didn't just show up on his own. I asked him to...

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.620
come and help me with something.

00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:17.530
I wasn't trying to ruin your mood by having him over.

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:19.530
Have you eaten?

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.800
- What about you? - Come on, I booked us breakfast.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.460
Seriously, where on earth did I put it?

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.680
Oh, my gosh!

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.850
Good grief.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.659
I don't know what she sees in him.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.200
Why isn't she looking forward?

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.850
- Hello. - Oh, hello.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.559
Here.

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.360
I had some extras again today.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.060
Oh, here you go again.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.159
You really don't have to.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.960
You didn't let me pay for ice cream last time either.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.029
If you keep doing this,

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.370
I'll have to stop accepting things from you.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:12.610
They're going to wilt soon anyway, so please, don't worry about it.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.140
Hey!

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.480
Yes?

00:36:17.481 --> 00:36:19.250
Well, I'll get going. Take care.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.190
Gosh.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.090
Is he just really shy?

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.560
When is he ever going to confess his feelings?

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.530
You don't get it?

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:34.160
He's giving them to every neighbour to hide that they're really for me.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.830
He's not my type, though.

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.039
- Ouch. - Just toss the rest of the flowers.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.540
Isn't it a hassle every single time?

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.110
You keep giving them away for free. Yes, that'll bring in customers.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.989
And if you do something like that, I bet your hair will be ripped out.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.990
I'd bet money on it.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.120
Yes, you're right.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.859
The thought of Sa Rang doing that really upsets me.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.390
I'd rip all his hair out.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.030
Sa Rang as in love? With whom?

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:14.569
- A boyfriend? - No.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.639
No, it's just, you know...

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.210
A future love, I guess?

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.450
Our Nu Ri needs to find someone someday.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.749
- I'm popular, you know. - Oh, really?

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.849
No, really, you have no idea.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:29.990
Take that back. Right now.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.010
Hey, you didn't say you were coming over today.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.580
What?

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.349
Wait, how did you even find my place?

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.650
Pardon the intrusion.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.590
What's this?

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.130
No, seriously. What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:12.830
Oh, this...

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.199
Since it's my first time here, this is for you.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.529
- What? - And...

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.640
this is something to snack on during our review session later.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.370
Since they're for a student, I made sure to get healthy options.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.310
Why didn't I even think of that?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.879
That's what I'm here for.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.179
You're something else, you know?

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.719
You're so thoughtful and detailed. Not what I'd expect from you.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.219
Must be in my nature.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.220
Right!

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.119
Oh, I forgot to get coffee.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.560
Don't worry, I was just about to brew some coffee.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.930
Anyone watching would think they're a married couple with a kid.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.110
Ouch, it's hot!

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.040
Hey, are you okay?

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.580
It's not hot.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.250
What?

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.020
Why didn't it boil?

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:15.320
Hey, it's not even plugged in.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.100
Why wasn't it plugged in?

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:22.630
Are you a dummy?

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.439
You...

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.009
- You should go. - What?

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.310
You being here...

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.909
I'm all nervous. Go home.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.210
Go on.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.050
Hurry up and go.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.080
That was surprisingly cute.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.890
Oh, what am I even saying?

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.230
Oh, that book...

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.369
Where did you get this?

00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:59.899
It was really hard to track down.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.740
It's been out of print for a long time.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.139
An autograph...

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.540
Could you sign it for me?

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.250
An autograph...

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720
Sure.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.320
("Waegeum")

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.229
Here you go.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.559
Gosh!

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.899
Gosh, this is incredible.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.300
So, how did you end up submitting your debut novel?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.670
I was eating ramen and using a book as a pot stand,

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.340
and I saw an ad for a writing contest in it.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.280
It offered prize money if I won, so I sent in my manuscript.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.249
- I kind of hate you right now. - Why?

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:44.779
It was the first thing you ever wrote?

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.179
And you didn't even enter the major contests?

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.320
I didn't even know those existed in the first place.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.189
It's not like I ever wanted to become a novelist anyway.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.759
Okay, now I really, really hate you.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.960
Oh, come on.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.059
By the way...

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.259
How long have you two been together?

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.330
Dating, I mean.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.270
Was that too forward of me?

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.239
It's just that you look so good together.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.439
We're just...

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.510
Yes, we're just friends.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.109
The kind of friends who cringe when people say stuff like that.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.550
- I see. - Just friends.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.220
Right.

00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:22.689
See? That's what I mean.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:24.190
That gives me the chills.

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:25.859
Well, I'll be going.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.289
And please tell the producer I said hello.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:30.529
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:31.890
Take care.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.170
So...

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.940
So you came to suck up to the producer's daughter.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.540
Well, a little of this, a little of that.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.379
I'm going to take off.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.710
I have to get back to the office.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.580
Want a ride?

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.319
Someone's in a good mood.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.320
Am I?

00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:04.059
Meeting a fan has you on cloud nine, doesn't it?

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.330
You're half right, and half...

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.930
So, how far are you letting me take you?

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.240
To the ends of the earth?

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.369
This...

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.870
Is this really giving me a ride?

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.680
Well...

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.610
It is a little inappropriate.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.550
I guess people aren't all that harsh on you after all.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.449
What's that supposed to mean?

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.790
I'm talking about that student, Yu Eun Ji.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.460
I was just...

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.130
in it for the money when I wrote it,

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:41.300
But thanks to her, it feels meaningful now.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:43.870
Hey, but...

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.239
How do you think she even got her hands on that?

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.300
- Oh, you mean your first book? - Yes.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.939
Hey, speaking of that.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.880
"My Beloved Gorilla?" What kind of title is that?

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.679
I mean, seriously.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.209
And you say, "I wish the world were a bit more beautiful?"

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:59.210
Unbelievable.

00:42:59.211 --> 00:43:00.950
You wish the world were more beautiful?

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.619
Who does? You?

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.990
You.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.459
You're the one who wrote it.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.460
I wrote that?

00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:09.860
Seriously, all three were the same. Did you plagiarize it or something?

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.030
I don't know. I guess that's just how I was back then.

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:14.730
I don't remember.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:18.430
Hey.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.800
Just ask me for it.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:23.840
I never have anyone in the passenger seat anyway.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:45.090
You get to the office safely.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.330
I'm going to take off from here.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:51.030
This whole setup is pretty inefficient, don't you think?

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.200
You said you have to go back, so I can't ask you to hang out.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.310
But I don't want to see you go.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:01.810
Je Yeon!

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.510
What? Oh my gosh!

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.490
Oh, Sang Yeop.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.689
Since when are we so casual?

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.930
I just like calling you that more than "Team Leader."

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.129
Still, people might get the wrong idea.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.099
It wouldn't hurt to be careful, right?

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.200
The wrong idea?

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.239
Then who's this?

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.100
I saw him getting out of your car.

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:31.739
Don't tell me...

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.740
Your boyfriend?

00:44:32.741 --> 00:44:35.080
No! It's not like that.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:39.720
He's just...

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:43.850
a cast member.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.660
Oh, the guy who's on that show with Tae Rin these days.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.529
Hi, I'm Lee Sang Yeop.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.829
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.260
Oh, it's fine.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.099
By the way, did you do something different with your hair?

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.229
What?

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:00.739
Oh, no, my hair...

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.969
It looks really good.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.570
What?

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.310
Well, this cast member will be on his way.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.880
- Well, take care. - You head on in.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.919
Are you heading to the office?

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.520
Yeah, the director summoned me about my military enlistment.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.489
We have to set a date.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:20.790
I see.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.859
If you got your draft notice, you should hurry up and enlist.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.890
You have to fulfil your duty to your country, don't you?

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.060
Go be a lifer for all I care.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.700
Sir.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.439
So...

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.439
The original author of "World Made of Ash."

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.179
We're coordinating a meeting date with him.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.110
So I have to see that ugly face again.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.780
Fine, whatever.

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:47.950
I'm putting you on leave. Go rest.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.990
It's a "vacation," if you catch my drift.

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.020
Han Dong Jun is on suspension too, starting today.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.690
For causing a scene at the company,

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:57.429
I'm sorry.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.359
My personal feelings aside,

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.300
the way you threw a lifeline to everyone involved...

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.200
That was the right thing you did.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.940
But he threw the first punch.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.650
Six years.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.890
My 1st vacation in 6 years. No...

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.990
More like a suspension, I guess?

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.270
This is lasting a long time.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.649
Hello! I'm the new hire starting today.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:55.949
I'm Choi Gi Ppeum!

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:58.949
I'm the only one here. You don't have to be so loud.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:59.960
Got it!

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:03.990
The chairs haven't arrived yet.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.430
Just grab an unopened box from over there and take a seat.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.600
It's not like I'm standing here to look cool or anything.

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.219
Oh, Tae Rin would be perfect for this.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.319
She'd know just how to sell a line like this.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.919
All done.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.590
What's next?

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.330
This newbie is clueless.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.230
Oh, should I go get some coffee?

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.800
Now that's a great idea.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.039
And get something for yourself too, if you'd like, Gi Ppeum.

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.040
Okay.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.010
Grab a power strip, too.

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.580
Head!

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.049
No stray thoughts!

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.219
I'm trying not to!

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.759
Focus.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.860
Last one!

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.930
Head!

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.110
What?

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.080
What are you doing here?

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:33.880
Beats me.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.990
Gosh.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.490
How much are you going to watch?

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:46.560
Let's see.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.060
I...

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.040
As much as I want.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.940
- Great work! - Great work!

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.380
Great work, everyone!

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.390
Oh, no...

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.160
Oh, come on.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:17.489
Who snores during meditation?

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.659
I didn't say anything weird, did I?

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.259
I wasn't talking in my sleep, was I?

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.699
Just stop coming here.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.399
How many times is that just this week?

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.440
We're all out of pain relief patches at the dojang because of you.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.070
Unbelievable.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.040
Maybe my mind is wandering because I'm not busy.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.650
Yes, I'll make it nice and full. Thank you. Bye.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280
Okay.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.190
Hi.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:50.559
What's with the look?

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.290
It feels like I've been seeing you a lot lately.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.060
Have we?

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.400
Seems like the plants change spots a lot, too.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.200
That?

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.469
If a plant is in one spot too long, people think it's not selling well.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.940
How would you know that? What, are you a mind reader?

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.810
Then go ahead and try reading my mind.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:12.110
- Why would I? - Good point.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:18.320
What was that about?

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.130
What did you do back when you got suspended?

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.190
What?

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.830
I mean, the vice principal suspended you, remember?

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:32.530
Kept you out of school for a week.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:36.970
Oh, right.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.409
But why bring that up now?

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.709
It's not exactly something to be proud of.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:43.710
Because I just got hit with something similar.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:48.450
I earned money.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.749
Took on more construction jobs.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:52.450
And did some package loading and unloading, too.

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.359
Oh, that place.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.259
There was this one place with an amazing home-style meal.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.760
I wonder if it's still around.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.030
Did you go there often back then?

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.700
Not really.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:09.000
If I stopped to eat, that meant less time to sleep.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.439
That day, after my shift, I was about to crash,

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.279
but I was afraid I wouldn't wake up in time.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:15.710
And it was my first day at my new school.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.880
I basically pulled an all-nighter and got on the bus...

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.250
and, of course, I fell asleep on it.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.390
So you just kept sleeping after you got here?

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.400
So you were watching me the whole time?

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.600
I was the class president.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.240
I was trying to set an example. Imagine how annoying it was for me.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.640
Gosh.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:51.279
I need to get back to work. Will you keep distracting me?

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.479
What are you doing after this?

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.019
I've got a part-time shift at Geon No's.

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.419
And after that?

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.750
Go home and sleep, of course.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.750
I see.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.490
That suspension must have really hit you hard.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.160
You've kind of lost it, haven't you?

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.800
Tell me about it.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:09.870
Why am I even here?

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.609
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.140
How am I looking at you?

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.190
Why do this after you've rejected me?

00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.520
Sung Je Yeon, karma will get you, you hear me?

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.530
Trust me, it already got me.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.270
Yes, Director.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.469
Go ahead. What is it?

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:54.279
I just hired a new person. What should I have him do?

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.349
Well, the company rules, document templates,

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.580
the company car policy... And stuff like that, you know.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.149
What about experience? How many years does he have?

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.990
Experience? None.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.560
Apparently, he just got back in the country.

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:08.889
I'm not even sure if he's graduated.

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:11.490
But you're supposed to hire someone with experience...

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.070
Excuse me. One bouquet, please.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.840
What's the occasion?

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.909
You've never bought flowers before.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:26.710
A mentor who was very special to me switched companies,

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.579
and it seems like they could use a visit.

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:31.280
Trying to make an impression?

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.110
Man or woman?

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:38.849
Why does that matter?

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.220
How long will it take? Are you going straight there now?

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:43.090
What, are you sad to see me go?

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.530
I ask all my customers the same thing.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.930
Would you like a card to go with that, ma'am?

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.900
A woman, 30 minutes, going straight there. No card.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.320
Gosh.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:15.120
That wasn't like me.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.900
All right. See you then, Mr. Accountant.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.700
Take care.

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.810
Are you Ms. Bang Han Na?

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.780
Here.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.320
Whatever the occasion, congratulations.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.849
You know, this is the first time I've ever bought a bouquet myself.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:45.050
Oh, my.

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.019
Where is it? Is this the place?

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.620
Gosh, this place is incredible.

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.159
What? Mo Tae Rin?

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.599
What are you doing here?

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.860
Hey there.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:58.029
I'm the one who snuck her over.

00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:59.229
You!

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:02.500
You traitors!

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.790
All that talk about conviction and faith...

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.930
You left spouting all those lofty words.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:27.859
So, where's the new hire manual I asked for?

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.300
I emailed it to you.

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.129
You know I don't give this manual out to just anyone, right?

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.340
You're a lifesaver. Thanks.

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:39.610
So, how is it being the first guest at "The New Utopia?"

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:44.609
What about this is so "utopian?"

00:55:44.610 --> 00:55:45.950
You said it yourself.

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:48.079
Instead of a company you have to work at,

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.219
the point is to build one that people want to work at.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.549
Well...

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.719
The company name is a little...

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.359
I never thought it was strange, but...

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.330
It does sound a bit like a cult, doesn't it?

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:05.900
You're laughing? You think this is funny?

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:08.539
You should've run this by me...

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.369
if you were going to join a company like this!

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:12.210
What do you mean, "a company like this?"

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:14.010
Oh, right.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.440
Tae Rin.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:19.610
Take a look.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.620
If you like it, I'll do what it takes to land it.

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.550
"Kongjwi and Patjwi?"

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.759
I worked so hard to get you into modern dramas,

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.259
and they want to stick her back in the Joseon era? Are you for real?

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.759
Actually, it's a modern crime drama.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.460
When did you get so quick to jump to conclusions?

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.430
Snack delivery!

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.940
- Oh, is he... - A celebrity.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.439
Gosh, a real celebrity.

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.110
Hello.

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:48.579
Say hi. This is our actress, Mo Tae Rin.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.950
And my former co-worker, Sung Je Yeon.

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.979
It's nice to meet you.

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.549
Get out while you still can.

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:55.979
You're dead set on being a manager?

00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.319
What are you talking about...

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.950
to a top talent from the prestigious University of Hong Kong?

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.489
I'm Choi Gi Ppeum.

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:04.229
This was the only place that offered me a job right away.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.589
Around here,

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:08.099
they value driving skills more than your education.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.260
What a shame.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.800
Let me give you a hand.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.639
Why is this here?

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.909
Because it looked like it belonged there.

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:19.109
It just felt right.

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:21.279
More like you didn't know how to throw it out!

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.449
Schedule a pickup, add a sticker, and they'll come get it.

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:25.749
So...

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.320
Should I look into a cleaning service, too?

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:31.149
First, we should probably ask the building management office.

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:34.320
All right, then, Gi Ppeum, you've got your first task.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.690
I'll go check with the management office.

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.190
- Go ahead. - Okay.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:46.669
He reminds you of when you were a rookie, doesn't he?

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:49.339
No, I was way quicker on the uptake.

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.670
Oh, come on.

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.519
I threw in a few extra stems.

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.550
Tell them we'd love to have their business again.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.090
I wonder if he only sent them for the business.

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:08.690
Ms. Bang Han Na sent flowers.

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:12.089
Director.

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:14.899
That flower delivery, the one from when Tae Rin was on the radio...

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.799
The one you sent.

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.229
By any chance,

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.469
did you order from that shop on purpose?

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.000
What shop? I don't know. Why?

00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:25.870
Fate is a funny thing.

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.040
So cruel, isn't it?

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.180
Why do I feel like I'm really being punished?

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:40.520
Normally,

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.360
I would've shaken it off after whining about being punished.

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.260
Hey.

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.600
Who are you talking to? You're kind of creeping me out.

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.529
That's what I'm saying.

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:54.499
I couldn't say a thing back.

00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.640
Why is she being so weird?

00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.669
But the shaman said there was nothing here.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:00.909
Oh, what...

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:04.250
Hey, stop it! That's actually scary!

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:06.049
And another thing.

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:09.150
Didn't I tell you not to waste money on that shaman?

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.850
She was wrong about every single thing.

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:18.160
Then it must be here.

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.460
Hey, are you okay?

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:25.970
Let me see.

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:27.870
Are you hurt?

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:31.540
Yes, I'm fine.

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:36.479
- Thank goodness it's shatter proof. - I'm sorry.

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.950
No, it's fine, really.

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:55.760
(Please come to the hospital for the checkup results.)

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:03.770
Eight, nine, one hundred.

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:08.779
One, two, three, four.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.510
I'd forgotten for so long...

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.119
what it feels like to have feelings for someone.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.620
How do you "vanish into blackness?"

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.320
Is that some kind of poem?

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.620
Hi.

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:20.250
Hello.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:40.170
I think I blew it.

01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:52.210
Happy birthday, Mom.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.790
I'm coming to see you tomorrow.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.250
Can I tell her about you?

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:04.429
Hey, why even ask?

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.190
Of course, you should tell her.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.060
What are you going to tell her?

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:11.570
I'm not telling.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.740
Mom.

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:18.510
You...

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.640
will like her too.

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:25.410
Yes.

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:46.830
And you haven't had any related symptoms?

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.640
Like unusual fatigue...

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.170
or any loss of sensation?

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:56.440
I'm prescribing a new medication for you to take along with it.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:59.850
The thing is, it's not covered by insurance...

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.350
Am I dying?

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:07.050
Amyloidosis is a very difficult and tricky disease.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.120
There aren't many cases in Korea either.

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:11.660
When am I going to die?

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.060
Well, to put it bluntly,

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.230
we don't know if it'll be tomorrow or ten years from now.

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:20.900
I know how agonizing that must be.

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:32.250
If I...

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.620
ever got the chance to meet my 19-year-old self,

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:39.820
then...

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:43.790
I'd give her some major spoilers about the rest of my life.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:47.459
"Have fun while you still can."

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.030
"This is what you should invest in."

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.230
"And dodge the day you get slapped."

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.370
What about you?

01:03:57.970 --> 01:03:58.970
Me?

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.480
Well...

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:04.250
I'd probably just buy him a meal.

01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:07.920
Hey, that makes me sound so shallow.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.990
Come on, give him some spoilers too.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.920
"At the end of the day,"

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.560
"life is one big gamble."

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.630
Good opening.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.069
I'm not sure about the rest, though.

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:29.599
What's he going to think when he hears that?

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.940
Come on, dig a little deeper.

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.880
"Since it's a gamble,"

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.520
"some days you'll win an insane amount."

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.630
"And on other days,"

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:53.890
"you'll get completely wiped out."

01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:59.930
(Congratulations on your graduation.)

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.320
(Sung Je Yeon)

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.940
Delivery for 505 in Building 102.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.380
Oh, this looks great.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.579
- Thanks. - Thank you. Take care.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.950
(Rose, 1 dollar each)

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:52.950
"For you, most days..."

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.420
"will probably be about losing a lot..."

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.700
"and only winning a little.'

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.300
"But even so,"

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.230
"you're not going to bet on misfortune."

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:14.010
Not the you...

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.840
that I know.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.740
What?

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.970
What did you tell your mom about me?

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:48.980
Did you badmouth me?

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.850
- What? - Well...

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.819
Bet you're wondering why I'm here.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:56.820
Yes.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.419
Getting excited?

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.420
You have to be. I know you are.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.940
I...

01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:22.480
I like you.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.620
I see.

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.250
Now? Of all times?

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.320
Gosh.

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:39.090
Am I...

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:41.560
way too late?

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.410
I guess I'm a real jerk.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.250
I shouldn't feel this good.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:13.930
But the world

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.640
looks kind of beautiful right now.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.550
(My Youth)

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:40.149
Let's make him think about just you.

01:09:40.150 --> 01:09:42.480
You have to set the mood first!

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:43.650
What are you trying to do?

01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:45.790
I have a plan.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:49.690
What did you want to be, Tae Rin?

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.360
Hae wrote a book?

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.830
I'm going to die.

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:56.860
If this happens again,

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:00.270
the end will be like this.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.970
Why are you doing this to me?

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.610
Let's stop seeing each other.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.110
To you,

01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:15.980
I mean just that much.
