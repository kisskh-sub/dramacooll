Darn it.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.100
Feels like we've been running
in circles.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.060
Hold on.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.070
Stop right there!

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.700
Where is the Emperor?

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.820
You're looking for the Emperor?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.470
What a pity.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.150
I'm not the Emperor,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.150
but a deposed Emperor.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.690
A deposed one is still an Emperor.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.450
Why not look for me instead?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.800
Where is he?

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.120
His Majesty returned long ago.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.960
You should give up that thought.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.080
Another of your schemes.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.520
He's taken your throne.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.520
Yet you're still out here serving him.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.440
Is it worth it?

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.980
Because I am a subject of the Great Han.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.620
A loser playing the hero, huh?

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.720
You failed to catch His Majesty.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.640
I doubt you can return and report success.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.590
Why not just

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.300
surrender here and now?

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.160
What a joke.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.710
Taking you back will do just as well.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.710
Am I that important?

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.840
Speak.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.610
What is the Qilin code?

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.360
Do you seek a long life too?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.960
What I want is the fall of the Great Han.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.470
Not talking?

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.370
I have ways to make you speak.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.930
Stop!

Li Nvxu.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.790
You used witchcraft

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.750
to harm the people,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.590
stirred up trouble,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.850
and plotted against His Majesty.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.560
Today, I will see you
brought to justice.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560
And one more crime.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.950
You held a vassal hostage.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.540
Can you?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.380

Speak.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.840
What is the Qilin code?

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.980
Speak.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.090
- Speak, now!
- Fine, I'll tell you.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.240
- I'll tell you.
- Wait.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.970
If you dare speak falsely

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.390
and the Qilin shows no sign,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.830
I'll end...

Surrender now without a fight.

the same characters.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.960
But for the jade pendant,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.760
it's written in a totally different way.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.580
Written like this.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.750
♪Flawlessness♪

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.640
♪Confession♪

(Western Han Dynasty,
Shenjue Year 3, 59 BC)

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.360
(Heng, how have you been?)

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.340
(My health hasn't been well these years.)

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.120
(My legs have grown unsteady.)

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.350
(Haihun Marquis's Mansion)
(But I'd still visit Chang'an)

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.360
(to pay respects to my grandfather.)

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.110
(We've all changed a lot
over the years.)

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.940
(Lord Gong isn't here with me.)

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.700
(At last, he can show his talent.)

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.980
(Bandits rose up in Bohai.)

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.840
(He went there as the Governor.)

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.070
Lay down your weapons.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.500
- (They say the bandits feared him.)
- Good.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.370
(I'm truly glad for him.)

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.000
Lay down your arms and we're good.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.910
(To be honest...)

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.360
Don't cause trouble again,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.080
(I miss the way he used to fuss at me.)

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.260
(Later, De Jiu traveled far to Xiqiang)

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.200
(to quell a rebellion.)

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.410
(She kept her word,)

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.850
(held on until the very last moment.)

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.150
(Qingge Tavern)
(Qingge's business is booming.)

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.350
- Welcome.
- Alright.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.520
(She returned to Changyi.)

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.400
Slow down, sir.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.390
(She reopened the long-abandoned tavern.)

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.480
(She told me)

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.770
- (you suggested some operation models,)
- Enjoy.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.510
(like a chain model)

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.510
(and franchise model.)

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.440
(She aimed to create a top tavern brand.)

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.930
(But my health was fading fast.)

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.380
(If only I could hold on and return)

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.890
- (to Changyi...)
- Alright.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.870
(share one more pot of her wine,)

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.430
(and see my homeland again,)

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.310
(then I would have no regrets.)

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.930
- (Also,)
- Your wine, sir.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.550
(when Kang Ning arrived in Haihun,)

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:32.870
(I realized then)

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.350
(he was none other than Emperor Liu Xun.)

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.720
(He was indeed a fine Emperor.)

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.730
(Under his rule, the Great Han)

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.840
(grew more prosperous.)

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.960
(As for me,)

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.240
(apart from having much gold,)

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.180
(which you already know,)

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.890
(I wanted to make Horse-hoof
and Qilin-hoof Gold Ingots.)

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.480
(as a token of sincerity)

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.480
(to convey my wish to worship ancestors
in Chang'an.)

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.260
(Hall of Four Seas as One)

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.740
Your Majesty, Haihun Marquis offers
Tributary Gold and Wine again

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.240
with the intent to return
to worship the ancestors.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.480
I accept his sincerity.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.000
But he has a leg disease.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.030
Long travel is unwise.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.390
He should focus on recovery.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.390
As for the gold and wine,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.910
let him keep it

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.040
and nurse his health.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.310
If we alone refuse his gold,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.350
the other vassals may feel estranged

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.830
and think you're showing favor.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.120
That would not be good for peace.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.230
You...

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.080
Then put it another way.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.200
Yes.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.750
I can keep cordial ties with Qi Chang.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.770
And the nephew can tolerate his uncle.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.120
But this Imperial Court

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.760
will never abide a deposed Emperor.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.340
Hush.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.640
What is it?

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.650
I'll get off.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.670
Marquis, I did not expect
to meet you here.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.660
Lord Jin.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.410
It has been over ten years.
How have you been?

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.420
I'm grateful you still remember.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.330
All is well.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.500
What brings you here this time?

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.640
Haihun Marquis Liu He,
receive the edict.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.670
The edict reads: Haihun Marquis Liu He,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.750
your virtue remains unrefined.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.090
Only the worthy in merit

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.150
and virtue may pay respects

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.080
to the ancestors in the Ancestral Temple.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.550
With Liu He deposed,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.840
his title no longer exists.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.930
He shall not offer rites to his ancestors.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.450
Let him keep to his place.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.080
So he may live out his days in peace.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.000
Proclaim this to all.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.550
So everyone may know.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.160
I receive the decree.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.380
Thank you, Lord Jin.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.710
Take care, Marquis.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.470
Move out.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.880
(I'd meant to finish all
and then find you.)

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.060
(But I suddenly realized)

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.530
(the things I wish to do
never come to pass.)

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.040
(Seems immortality
holds no meaning for me.)

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.480
(If that is the case...)

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.770
Bronze Qilin,

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.390
guard the universe.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.530
The firmament shines,

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.070
granting my wish.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.460
Changes are cyclical,

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.260
eternal as sun and moon.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.560
Unveil the mysteries,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.760
all at my command.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.140
(Wang Heng)

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.810
Guys, stay sharp.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.660
Let me go! Let me go!

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.300
Let me go! Let me go!

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.150
Tomb robber!

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.450
- Boss.
- Release me!

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.140
- We found a child.
- Let me go!

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.030
Throw him into the pit.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.260
- Bury him.
- Let me go!

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.790
Who disturbs my rest?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.480
Wang Heng!

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.470
Wang Heng, where are you?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.110
Immortal.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.640
Are you here to take me with you?

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:25.960
Your name is Wang Heng.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:26.850
That's right.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.240
First, answer me a few questions.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.240
Alright.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.750
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:32.860
No.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.040
You need to say,

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.720
"I'll speak of all I know,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.400
leaving nothing unsaid."

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.830
I'll speak of all I know,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.550
leaving nothing unsaid.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.370
Where am I?

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.880
In Yongxiu County.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.860
What year is it?

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.810
The year 2011.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.990
That means it's over 2,000 years later.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.350
Immortal.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.880
I still have matters unfinished.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.680
When I am done,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.310
come and fetch me.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.970
Wang Heng!

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.790
Where are you, Wang Heng?

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.040
Run!

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.510
Let's go somewhere else.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.430
Running again?
