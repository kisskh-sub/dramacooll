00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.540
(Episode 65)

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.680
Easy now.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.440
I feel terrible that you got hurt
because of me.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.450
Don't say that.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.620
I'll protect you from now on, Se Ri.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.390
I guess I really lucked out.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.760
A few scratches
in exchange for a lifetime bodyguard.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.260
Get some rest. I'll make you a snack.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.820
What's wrong? What are you doing here?

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.350
Are you okay?

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.120
You're not hurt, are you?

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.230
It's just a little scratch. Why?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.600
Mom!

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.070
(Operating Theater Center)

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.810
- Did it hurt a lot?
- A little.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.690
How could he push me away
and end up in her arms?

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.660
(Mingang Distribution)

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.930
What's wrong with you?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.730
Did you get your feelings hurt
or something?

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.600
Then again, that's not possible for you.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.710
And why not? Can't I get my feelings hurt?

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.910
I'm human too, you know.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.980
You're not. Don't you know?

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.550
Come on. That's so ridiculous,
even a passing dog would laugh.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.750
What do you want?

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.220
Let's have a drink after work
with Soo Jung...

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.850
to celebrate my return to work.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.720
I'm not in the mood.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.330
You wanted to do what?

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.560
I asked her out for drinks!
I thought we could finally hang out.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.400
Was that her idea?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.770
No, she shot me down flat.
Something must be up.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.340
She looked like she'd been betrayed.
She was in a foul mood.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.710
Her?

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.810
No way.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.610
She's the one who does the hurting,
not the one who gets hurt.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.550
My point exactly.
That's what makes it so strange.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
How about we grab a drink then,
just the two of us?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.450
Let's just drink at home then.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.390
Because this isn't something
we can talk about at home.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.320
What is it that's so secretive?

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.730
Didn't you hear about what happened
to the chairman of Ilhan Construction?

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.630
He suddenly came down with dementia,
and now his family's a total mess.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
He was declared legally incompetent
before he could even name a successor.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.170
I know this is shameless,
but if you'll just wait a few days,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.940
I'll take care of the hospital bill.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.150
I guess the amount I offered before
was a little low.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.220
I hear your husband is in the ICU
at Hankuk Hospital.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.960
And you're about to be forced out
because you can't pay the bills.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.130
How do you know that?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.170
I can take care of all of that for you.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.000
So just tell me.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.500
If he's not Moon Tae Kyung,
then who is it?

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.910
Who is that man passing himself off
as Director Moon Tae Kyung?

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.680
Tell me why he has to hide his identity
and live as someone else.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.880
Tell me everything you know.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.350
And why should I?

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.620
Even if I knew,
how could I be the one to say anything?

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.790
After everything CEO Han has done for me.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960
CEO Han?

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.530
Who's that?

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.030
Look, I told you
I'd pay all the overdue hospital bills!

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.740
It's a very fair offer, isn't it?

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.640
Come on, just tell me.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.350
There's something I've been meaning
to ask you, sir.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.050
What is it?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.450
It's about the men's personnel files.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.490
Why did you look into that?

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.350
What's it to you?

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.090
I'm investigating someone at the moment,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.090
and I was wondering
if you had the same reason, sir.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.100
And who are you investigating?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.800
I was looking to see
if there was anyone...

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.900
who had joined the company
under a false identity.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.600
I was planning to report to you
once I had something more concrete.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.040
Finally. It seems we're on the same page.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.610
Come to my house this evening.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.350
By any chance,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.390
have you heard what's happening
at Gyemyeong Distribution?

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.190
I've heard bits and pieces.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.660
How serious is it?

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.560
Even without any major cash outflow,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.590
their reserves aren't growing.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.500
Which means someone is skimming cash
off the top.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.470
Exactly. This is usually found
in new startups...

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.940
that are undergoing rapid expansion.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.370
So this is highly unusual.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.610
When revenue is flat,
but cash reserves are shrinking,

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.110
it means there's a leak somewhere.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.620
Why should we care what happens
to another company?

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.950
No company is immune to this.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.420
Are you worried?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.890
Or are you just fearmongering?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.360
If I have to be blunt,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.130
neither.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.800
It's simply a fact-check.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.470
When you give one person
too much authority,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.940
it's only prudent to be suspicious
and do your due diligence.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.170
Is this about Lawyer Kim again?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.580
Manager Jung, what's up?

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.980
Hello.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.690
Moon Tae Kyung
is tracing Gyemyeong's funds.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.720
Why would he be doing that
all of a sudden?

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.760
Well, since their financial structure
is so similar to Mingang Distribution's,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.000
it looks like he's planning to use it
to persuade CEO Min.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.170
So he'll make CEO Min suspicious of me...

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.800
and get her to dig into my past?

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.270
Yes, that's right. If that happens,
the flow of the chairman's dirty money...

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.310
will be exposed eventually.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.740
They'll find the double ledger
and borrowed-name accounts.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.410
Please don't let Moon Tae Kyung
get in CEO Min's ear anymore.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.780
If CEO Min starts to waver
because of him, it's all over for us.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.390
All right.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.000
You've visited the CEO's office
quite often lately.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.340
Are you working on a secret project
or something?

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.890
Whatever Moon Tae Kyung tells you,
take it with a grain of salt.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.920
What's that supposed to mean?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.490
I'm saying it's not worth considering,
so don't pay any mind to it.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.490
That's for me to decide, isn't it?

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.000
I told you his reason
for approaching you before.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.370
He wants to drive a wedge between us
so that you'll stop trusting me.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.010
And I believe I told you...

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.510
that Director Moon has nothing to gain
from any of this.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.440
That depends on how you look at it.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.780
What if it's not about
what he has to gain?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.650
Other motives?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.120
To help Baek Sul Hee get her revenge,
for example.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.020
Regardless of what his objective is,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.760
you have to trust me,
just as you always have.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.760
I do trust you.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.030
But whether or not I choose
to trust Director Moon...

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.100
is not something you get to dictate.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.470
Wouldn't you agree?

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.280
Seriously.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.250
Since when did she trust Moon Tae Kyung?

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.450
I guess she'll have to get burned
to learn her lesson.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.590
I found out who Se Ri's birth mother is.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.300
You said you'd find out for certain.
So you did?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.730
Yes, I'm positive.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.700
So who is it?

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.300
It's Min Kyung Chae.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.870
Are you serious?

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.980
Is CEO Min
really that little brat's birth mother?

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.280
I can't believe it.
How could this even happen?

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.380
And that just makes me even more furious.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.980
She's a mother herself after all,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.320
but how could she do that to our Mi So?

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.220
I know, right?
A mother's love shouldn't be so cruel.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.060
It's a selfish mother's love.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.660
She tried to hide
her child's wrongdoing...

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.460
by framing an innocent child
for the crime.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.130
So, what are you going to do now?

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:53.070
I'm going to make sure she dies
without her daughter calling her "Mom."

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.680
I'll make that girl, Se Ri, worship me.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:03.080
She needs to feel what it's like
to be rejected by her own daughter.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.090
Only then will she have an inkling
of what it's like to lose a child.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.090
Good.
Give her a taste of her own medicine.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.630
That evil wench!

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.500
How mean!

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.870
How could she hide that for 20 years?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.200
Is CEO Min really Se Ri's birth mother?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.900
Apparently so.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.810
But she's nothing like her birth mother.
Who on earth does she take after?

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.410
Maybe it's from her father's side?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.110
By the way, how long did Ho Se
and that woman date?

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.880
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.590
Well, I don't know for sure.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.890
They were seeing each other in secret.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.290
I was just wondering if Se Ri
might be Ho Se's daughter.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360
That's ridiculous!

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.030
There's no way she's my flesh and blood.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.330
If she were Ho Se's child,
you think he wouldn't have told me?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.800
You're right.
He isn't the type to abandon his own kid.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.040
Absolutely not.
If she were his blood, I would have known.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:08.250
She doesn't look anything like Ho Se,
and she acts even less like him.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.380
It can't be her.
The idea that she could be one of us...

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.250
Please!
Just thinking about it is sickening.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.760
Welcome. It's been a while, Lawyer Kim.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.900
The chairman asked me
to come to the house.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.340
Yes, I was informed.
The chairman will be here shortly.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.800
Is the rest of the family not here?

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.280
Chairman Min had a last-minute meeting,
so she said she'll be late.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.410
Ji Seop and his wife went
to her parents' house,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.680
and Soo Jung is never home early,
as you know.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.250
What about the youngest, Se Ri?

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.050
She was in a bit of an accident earlier,

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.790
so she took medicine
and went to bed early.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.290
An incident?

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.030
It was nothing serious.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.890
Oh, right. What about dinner?

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.760
I'll eat with the chairman when he's here.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.210
Good evening, Ma'am.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.240
What are you doing here?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.140
The chairman invited him.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.890
What do you think you're doing,
waltzing in here?

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.500
I was just dying to see the love nest
you've built with that old chairman.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.770
I don't know how you can stomach it.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.100
You can really stand
being with Chairman Min?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.180
What do you see in that greedy,
grotesque old man to come all this way?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.040
I lived with the likes of you.
This is nothing.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.950
At least I was young.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.520
You struggled to support a student,

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.150
but I made sure you were
more than satisfied in other areas.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:03.290
I doubt that old geezer
can even perform in bed.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.160
Cut the disgusting nonsense.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.030
Is that why you're still hung up
on Moon Tae Kyung?

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.200
I saw it plain as day at your wedding.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.310
That passionate look
you and Moon Tae Kyung exchanged!

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.870
IT was amazing!

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.480
Do you think of Moon Tae Kyung...

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.080
in the chairman's arms every night?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.050
Maybe you two are having secret flings.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.660
How dare you! Just because
you're the chairman's wife now,

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.420
you think you can just hit people?

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.200
You know that ledger you made off with?

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.500
I've been thinking about
where you might have hidden it.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.040
You wouldn't keep it here.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.410
So, Madam Jang's hotel?
No, that's not it either.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.010
Since I know about you two,
there's no way you'd leave them there.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.350
Go ahead. Try to find them.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.350
You're so clever, after all.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.550
My guess is...

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.790
it's in Moon Tae Kyung's possession.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.790
And that's why he is acting so cocky.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.330
You sound like a bad soap opera.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.100
But then, that's about your speed.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.300
What makes you think
I would give it to him?

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.140
Otherwise, what gives him the gall
to turn the chairman against me?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.680
He knows fully well that
removing Moon Tae Kyung would be nothing.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.050
In that case, I should tell the chairman
to get rid of you first.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.790
Why do you think Chairman Min
had me over today?

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.160
I told you I wouldn't let you two get away
with this, didn't I?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.830
Don't you dare touch him.
He's not for you to frame and mess with.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.830
I'm tearing up over here.
So this is real love?

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.140
You'd better worry about yourself.
Before Moon Tae Kyung goes down,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.210
you're going down first.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.110
Just because people call you "ma'am,"
you think you're the lady of the manor.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.140
What's that supposed to mean?

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.750
What do you think it means?

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.650
You're nothing but a trophy wife.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.560
You want to try me again?

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.290
Darn you!

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.700
Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.070
How dare you!

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.670
Did I hit a nerve? Did I?

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.550
You've completely lost your mind.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.920
I must have struck a nerve.
Look at you flailing like that.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.240
Don't mess with me! You hear me?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.210
Thrash around all you want. It's useless.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.650
You're still just the same old
Baek Sul Hee.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.590
Who do you think you're messing with?

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.430
Ma'am.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.300
Ma'am?

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.370
Ma'am, is everything all right in there?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.570
May I come in for a moment?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.080
Manager Gong,
what are you doing over there?

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.320
I was just checking on something.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.050
I'm hungry.
I guess because I didn't eat earlier.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.250
Oh, well...

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.150
Should I prepare something for you now?

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.920
What are you waiting for?
I said I'm hungry.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.530
Yes.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.810
I'll leave first. You come out later.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.190
Yes, sir.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.530
Oh, yes, that's fine.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.230
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.270
Understood.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.920
Lawyer Kim, where have you been?
I was hoping to offer you some juice.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.460
I just went to the restroom.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.030
The chairman said something came up,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.930
- so I'll come back another time.
- I see.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.070
I'll be taking my leave, ma'am.

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.840
Yes. Take care.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.850
I have my job back, but it's just a start.
I still need to get promoted.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:27.520
I know. I told you to ask Dad
to promote you.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.050
What's the point of going back
if you're stuck in the same position?

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.460
Your dad will take care of it.
You think he'd just let you rot there?

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.300
If he's going to become a department head,
then a director, and finally president,

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.930
he's already way behind schedule.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.000
By the way, where's Mr. Oh?
I haven't seen him around.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.940
He is a busy man these days.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.040
He said something
about studying the firm thoroughly...

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.140
to be an independent director.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.310
You mean he's at my company right now?

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.210
Knock, knock.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.110
Hello, Mr. Min.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.780
You're working late tonight, I see.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.080
What brings you here at this hour?

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.990
No special reason. I was just passing by.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.420
It's practically my company now.
If I don't look after it, who will?

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.230
Now he's brazenly acting
like he owns the place.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.930
Please have a seat.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.570
No, thank you.
Standing here in Mingang feels wonderful.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.740
I doubt you just dropped by for no reason.
What's on your mind?

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.310
You know, come to think of it,

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.980
the independent director position
seems a little beneath me.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.980
What do you mean by that?

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.180
It seems like a perfectly suitable
position to me.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.490
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.260
Now you're just hurting my feelings,
you know?

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.630
You seem to be forgetting
what I have on you.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.570
I'll be generous and start
as an independent director,

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.970
but we'll be moving up step-by-step.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.840
Oh, and by the way, my secret safe
is perfectly secure,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.710
so you can rest easy.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.550
I'll be on my way.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.350
I'm completely hooked on Mingang

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.390
I'm completely hooked on Mingang

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.630
(Mingang Distribution)

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.400
(Chairman Min Doo Sik)

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.030
If I let him get away with this,

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.530
he'll blackmail me forever.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.770
That greedy man isn't going to stop here.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.980
What if he uses the contract as bait
to take over Mingang?

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.710
That darn Oh Pan Sool!

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.280
My head is killing me.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.620
We're going
to hit Oh Pan Sool's house soon.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.990
What are you talking about?

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.920
I told you before
that we're going to steal...

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.260
your parents' contract
in Oh Pan Sool's secret safe.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.770
We're not asking you to break the law.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.370
We'll handle it ourselves.
All you do is look away.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.370
You know the saying, right?
We will be the sinners,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.210
so you can be the bystander.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.210
Now that the last witness
has been murdered,

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.350
you have no one left to turn to.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.750
But it wouldn't be admissible as evidence.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.850
Still, it's better if we have it.
How long are you going to let him keep it?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.990
What if, by some stroke of bad luck,
Min Doo Sik...

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.960
finds out where that contract is?
It would be a disaster.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.460
When are we doing this?

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.300
To make the break-in look natural,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.730
it's best when
Oh Pan Sool and his wife are out.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.270
We have to wait for the right moment.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.180
Honey, I told you to keep water...

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.410
by your bedside before going to sleep.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.150
Wait a minute.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.220
Is that really a thief standing before me?
Or am I dreaming?

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.850
What's going on?

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.390
My safe! Darn you!

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.330
You've got some nerve.
Do you know who you're messing with?

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.160
Dream or not, I have to catch him!
Yang Mal Sook!

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.600
Call the police!

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.670
Give me back my safe!

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.200
My safe!

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.910
Give me back my safe! Give it back!

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.080
Mr. Oh!

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.850
Watch out!

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.390
Oh no!

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.690
Catch him!

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.990
- Mr. Oh!
- We have to catch him!

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.130
Are you all right?

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.360
Never mind me. We have to catch him.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.670
My goodness! Are you okay?
What on earth is going on at this hour?

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.470
Can't you see?
Some thief stole my safe and ran.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.410
The safe? You mean...

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.340
the one where you keep all the collateral?

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.680
Yes, that one.
How did he know it was behind the frame?

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.920
That jerk!

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.220
Where are you going dressed like that?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.520
Do you think I care
what I'm wearing right now?

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.190
If that safe is gone, I'm finished.
I can't just stand here...

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.960
I'll go. Please stay here.
It could be dangerous.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.930
That safe is everything I have!

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.070
I know this is a terrible shock,
so please try to calm down.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.600
I'm going to go call the police now.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.570
That's right. Calm down.
He said he'll take care of it.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.480
You have to catch him!
You have to bring him back!

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.150
Oh my goodness!

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.050
- My safe...
- Oh, my heart is racing!

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.850
- It's pounding. Oh dear.
- My safe...

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.220
My safe...

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.260
My safe...

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.660
Honey.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.900
Here, get up and have some cold water.
It'll help settle your nerves.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.070
My safe.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.630
Wait...

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.170
How long has he been gone?
What's taking him so long?

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:33.440
He said he was going to the police.
I'm sure he's handling it, so be patient.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.980
I should've gone myself.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.620
Who is it?

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.420
Hello? Hello. Is this Mr. Oh Pan Sool?

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.860
This is he, but I'm not having a good day.
If this isn't important, I'm hanging up.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.330
This is the police.
I'm calling about your safe.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.430
What?

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.730
You found the safe?

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.710
And with that, the bad karma between me
and Han Kyung Soo is finally over.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.410
That punk infiltrated Mingang
to avenge his father.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.280
Go on, let him try without any witnesses
or evidence.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.990
He'll cling to a revenge
he can never get...

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.420
and it will ultimately be his ruin.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.890
First, I'll find out who you are,
you punk.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.500
And I'll send you to join your father.

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.310
Who was that?
The person who visited earlier.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.880
He forgot some important papers,
so I had him bring them.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.650
- Oh, is that all?
- Yes. They're all here.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.920
Has something good happened?
You seem to be in a great mood.

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.160
A nagging little problem has been solved.
You know, like a hangnail?

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.960
It's nothing major, but it's irritating.
That kind of thing.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.130
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
Time for your medicine.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.310
Are you sleeping
in Se Ri's room again tonight?

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.580
I already told you. She's shocked
by the accident and needs me.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.650
Please get a good night's sleep.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.830
(Han Kyung Soo)

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.710
What are you looking at so intently?

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.530
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.620
Does he go by any other names
besides Moon Tae Kyung?

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.390
- So you have someone in mind.
- He's very close to you, sir.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.760
But if you slip up,
Tae Kyung's cover will be blown.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.230
I like to think my real mom in heaven
sent you to me as a gift.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.370
But I'm right here in front of you.
I'm your real mother.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.840
I'm the one who gave birth to you.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.940
