[Shadow Love]

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.970
[Episode 32]

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.840
I didn't expect

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.690
the mighty General of Cavalry

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.190
of Taijin

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.430
to be such a craven coward,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.870
too afraid to lead the campaign himself.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.840
Instead, he sent his daughter

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.750
to her death.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.829
Why use a butcher's blade
to kill a chicken?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.220
You should be grateful
that it was me who came.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.420
Otherwise, you would

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.610
already be in the ground,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.250
keeping your emperor company by now.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.530
You talk boldly
even with death staring you in the face.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.680
You do have some nerve.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.050
If you wanted to kill me,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.120
you would've done it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.329
before the armies to assert your power.

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.329
You wouldn't have waited until now.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.400
It seems
you're not entirely without merit.

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.750
You've got a quick mind.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.050
But don't let that cleverness
be your downfall.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.470
The timing of your death

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
significantly

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.240
impacts the outcome.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.490
Write a letter of surrender.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.930
Have Taijin release Yao State's prisoners.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.680
Then I will show mercy

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.590
and spare your life.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.820
Trading my life

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.430
for thousands of prisoners—

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.480
if it were you,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.310
would you agree?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.800
It might not work if it's someone else.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.270
But I heard

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.430
you share a deep relationship

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.380
with Taijin's emperor.

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.090
I imagine he wouldn't want

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.160
his beautiful companion

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.470
to die at his enemy's hands.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.520
You...

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.410
And mind you,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.660
even without you,

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.180
I can still get what I want.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.980
I'll march on Taijin one day

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.880
and trample every camp.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.030
I can still rescue my men.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.390
I'm only giving you a chance to live

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.830
because

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.920
I see there's some spirit in you.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.750
With you captured,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.409
I doubt your useless subordinates

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.630
would dare attack the city on their own.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.960
There's plenty of time.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.490
Think carefully.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.120
I wanted to take this opportunity
to get rid of him once and for all,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.180
but unexpectedly,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.720
he actually won the battle.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.900
Though Prince Annan is arrogant,

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.570
he has considerable talent
in leading troops.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.350
This victory, after all,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.430
has resolved our immediate crisis.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.990
Are you implying

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.240
Yao State has no one else left to rely on?

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.560
I misspoke.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.740
Duan Aodeng is of royal blood.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.360
His prestige at court
remains undiminished.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.230
Now he's earned military merit.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.950
Those old ministers

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.620
are all opportunists.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.670
With a few whispers in their ears,

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.540
they might waver in loyalty.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.940
I will not allow anyone

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.300
to threaten Yu's throne.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.450
Duan Aodeng

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.890
must die.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.300
Your Majesty,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.180
Li Shuang, General of the Changfeng Army,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.380
is currently held in the prisoner camp.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.060
If we use her properly,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.010
perhaps

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.620
she can help us

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.200
eliminate Prince Annan.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.770
You mean

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.450
that female general from Taijin
who was once close to him?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.700
Old love and past favors
are not easy to forget.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.770
But why would she help us?

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.770
Before, perhaps not.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.450
But before Prince Annan left Taijin,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.140
he plotted an assassination attempt
against Li Wei.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.000
A rift already lies between them.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:34.690
Besides,

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.490
Li Shuang comes
from a military background.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.890
She is no ordinary woman.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.059
Now with the 2 armies facing off,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.539
amid national enmity and personal grudges,

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.299
if someone

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.330
gives her an opportunity,

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.420
she will certainly seize it

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.140
to kill her powerful enemy.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.900
But Prince Annan

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.090
has already forgotten

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.940
his years spent in Taijin.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.710
Would he lower his guard

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.780
before a female general of the enemy?

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.850
That is why
someone must be behind the scenes

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.420
to stir the waves.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.420
I was right to place my trust in you.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.090
I promise you

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.580
a high ministerial position.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.090
If this matter is handled well,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.190
there will be additional rewards.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.520
I will not fail this mission.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
I'll ease your burdens, Your Majesty.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.140
Remember,

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.130
when putting on a show,
make it convincing.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.690
When the time comes, show no mercy.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.900
Just make sure Li Shuang

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.650
is left with a breath of life.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.660
As you command.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.780
General Li,

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:49.970
how have you been?

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.980
How could they treat you
with such disrespect?

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.570
You've suffered greatly, General.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.420
Stop the act.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.300
If you're here
to persuade me to surrender,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.300
don't waste your time on me.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.110
The Changfeng Army's soldiers
would rather die fighting.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.780
We will never surrender.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.480
Why must you be so stubborn, General?

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.220
We each serve our own ruler.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.780
I don't wish
to make things difficult for you.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.780
If you just write a letter of surrender,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.490
I

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.570
will vouch for your safety.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:41.690
You curs!

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.180
You bunch of damned curs!

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.610
What other tricks you've got—

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.940
just bring them on!

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.450
Kneel!

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.660
Bring them on!

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.730
Lyu Yi! Qin Wu!

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.430
General!

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.250
General!

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.510
What are you going to do?

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.810
They were captured with you.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.310
I heard
you care about your soldiers very much.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.950
I assume

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.520
you'll surely care about their lives.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.420
You're a clever woman, General.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.940
You know what must be done.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:10.690
You...

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.840
I'll ask you one more time.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.460
The letter of surrender—

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:21.740
will you write it

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.380
or not?

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.660
Let them go!

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.180
If you've got the guts, come at me!

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.730
Don't hurt innocent people!

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.730
Release them!

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.730
You cur!

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.320
Your complacency won't last long.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.260
Taijin's formidable army
will tear you limb from limb!

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.900
Lyu Yi!

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.590
You cur! You'll die a horrible death!

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.300
Lyu Yi!

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.730
Lyu Yi.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.570
Will you

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.490
write it or not?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.060
Let him go.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.850
Release him!

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.180
General,

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.730
I am just a soldier.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.810
I was honored by your trust and promotion.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.450
I can never
repay your kindness in this life.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.140
Now,

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.730
to die for my country

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.420
is my greatest honor!

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.810
I

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.790
must take my final journey now.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.250
They're dead.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.060
Bai Kun.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.730
I will kill you.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.540
I swear I will kill you!

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.330
Don't blame me, General.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.470
It's Prince Annan's order.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.930
Who dares to disobey?

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.630
My patience is limited.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.310
You'd better decide soon,

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.420
unless you want more suffering.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.350
If you have the nerve, just kill me!

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.130
Stop wasting time.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.960
What a Beautiful Lord of Hell.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.260
Let's see how long you can hold out.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.610
Torture her!

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.980
The wounded soldiers

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.180
must be properly taken care of.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.910
The families of the fallen

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.330
should receive compensation without delay.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.540
No embezzlement is permitted.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.140
Please rest assured, Prince Annan.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.270
I will personally oversee the matter.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.850
But there is one thing I don't understand.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.610
Since we've captured Li Shuang,

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.140
why not just kill her?

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.240
It could strike fear into Taijin.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.430
Though we won this battle,

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.970
our supplies and troops
have been severely depleted.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.380
Recovery will take time.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.060
The soldiers

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.420
also need rest.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.850
Rather than
seeking immediate satisfaction,

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.450
it's better to keep her alive

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.420
to use her as a check against Taijin.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.330
Since she's a member of the Li family,

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.330
Li Wei certainly won't abandon her.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.570
And only when Li Wei shows himself

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.730
can I avenge my brother.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.090
Understood.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.020
Has she agreed to surrender?

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.660
She is unyielding.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.220
She's been on a hunger strike for days.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.480
If this continues,

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.410
she'll starve herself to death.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.390
It seems I underestimated her.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.380
Perhaps some suffering will do her good.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.300
Otherwise,

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.730
she can't see
the reality of her situation.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.330
Prince Annan, you're right.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.300
But...

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.570
But Bai Kun went to the camp today.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.060
As you know,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.940
he's always been ruthless.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.420
No matter how strong-willed Li Shuang is,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.360
I'm afraid

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.160
she can't withstand his methods.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.420
Bai Kun?

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.060
General, why are you so stubborn?

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.290
Just write a letter of surrender

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.410
and you'll regain your freedom.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.610
After that,

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.590
even if you don't want
to return to Taijin,

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.780
I can speak for you

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.190
and guarantee you
a life of wealth and honor.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.380
You want me to surrender? Fine.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.380
I want every official of Yao State

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.660
to bow their heads,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.420
the royal family to kneel in submission,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.280
and you...

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.420
to be torn into pieces.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.920
I'd like to see

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.020
if there will ever be a time
when you beg for mercy.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.300
Everyone,

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.730
she's the mighty General of the North
of Taijin.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.850
Today,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.660
I'm giving her to you all
as a reward!

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.510
-Thank you, My Lord.
-Thank you, My Lord.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.110
-Prince Annan.
-Prince Annan.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.960
Torturing and killing prisoners
in the camp without authorization—

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.670
what do you take military discipline for?

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.500
Jin'an.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.640
You... You...

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.940
I came to interrogate her
under the Empress Dowager's order.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.100
Prince Annan,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.940
why are you interfering?

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.670
Using the Empress Dowager to threaten me?

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.050
Have I ever been afraid?

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.950
You bypassed my authority

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.580
to torture her without permission.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.140
In the army,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.120
that's a capital offense.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.340
Jin'an.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.380
Jin'an.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.340
Why do I feel uneasy

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.250
whenever I hear this name?

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.180
Who is

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.380
this Jin'an?

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.460
You're awake.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.900
Those prison guards

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.730
have been dealt with
according to military law.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.140
There are no women in the army.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:18.940
You'll have to

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.350
tend to your wounds yourself.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.180
If you want to avenge your brother,

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.070
you can simply kill me.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.580
If you want to harm me,

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.010
I advise you to save your strength.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.540
In your current condition,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.580
you can't so much as scratch me.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.960
Besides, each debt has its owner.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.860
One day, I will take Li Wei's life myself,

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.390
but I won't involve others.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.440
You want to die now?

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.660
I won't allow it.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.180
What happened today

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.250
will not happen again.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.410
I will have medicine delivered regularly.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:18.990
Rest and recover here.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.770
Don't think about dying for honor.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.420
If you die,

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.470
those soldiers of yours

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.280
will be buried with you.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.820
Prince Annan, please wait!

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.860
I haven't reported
to the Empress Dowager yet!

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.320
This...

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.130
This is against the rule!

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.700
Your Majesty.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.580
Prince Annan, you're so bold.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.500
How dare you enter the harem

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.970
without permission?

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.140
You only care about

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.350
my intrusion into your chambers.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.940
You don't care about his life at all.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:15.290
I suppose

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.080
you already know why I'm here.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.010
Defying me is nothing new for you.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.940
When the late emperor was alive,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.220
there was always someone
to clean up your mess.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.050
Now that he is gone,

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.020
aren't you worried one imperial decree

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:40.620
could cost you your life?

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.290
If I'm afraid,

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.740
I wouldn't have come here today.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.580
I command the army by imperial decree.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.380
Military law is stern and absolute.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.310
It brooks no outside interference

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.380
or insolence.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:00.820
I believe

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.520
you know that better than anyone.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.220
Though the emperor is young,

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.820
in matters of governance and law,

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.350
he has entrusted ministers

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.250
like Zuo Chengzhi and Qiu Tai

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:15.730
to assist him.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.600
There's no need for external intervention.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:20.210
Your Majesty, please

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.780
remain peacefully in the harem

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.740
and take good care of yourself.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.580
Your Majesty.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.620
Shut up!

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.720
-Prince Annan.
-Prince Annan.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.490
Does she still refuse to eat or drink?

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:03.530
She ate a little

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.650
but soon vomited everything up.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:07.180
The imperial physician you sent

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.660
already came to examine her this morning.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.730
The imperial physician said

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.340
it was because of her grief.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.620
Bai Kun has been dealt with
according to military law.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.490
Consider it my explanation to you.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.660
Stop pretending.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.210
Bai Kun told me himself

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.100
he did all that under your orders.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.900
But now you are putting on an act.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.450
So hypocritical.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.190
I don't need to explain to you,

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:11.260
but I have always been aboveboard.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.140
I'll never

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.880
let anyone slander me.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.270
Since childhood, I've always earned

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.600
what I want through my own abilities.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.970
If I'm the same type of person as Bai Kun,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.040
do you think you'd still be alive?

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:29.660
We are both commanders.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.090
The soldiers who serve under us

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.350
fight alongside us on the battlefields.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.490
That bond is one of life and death.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.900
How could I stoop so low

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.660
as to use their lives

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:41.890
to force your surrender?

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.360
If you can't stomach food,

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.030
have a few candies.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.920
Your men died for you.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.470
Don't let them die in vain.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.250

Miss Lu,

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.580
Master has given orders:

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.140
starting today,
he will enter closed-door cultivation.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.580
Unless it's a matter of life and death
for the Wuling Mountain,

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.860
no one is to disturb him.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.770
He just lost to me
in the medical contest yesterday,

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.610
and today he's in seclusion?

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.090
I'm afraid he's ashamed of losing to me

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.620
and is hiding like a coward.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.250
Master,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.310
we agreed

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.870
the loser has to pound
1,000 bundles of herbs.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:39.770

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.450
And you—

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.740
covering for him and lying to me.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.500
Fine then.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.690
I won't tell you any more stories
from down the mountain.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.380
Please don't, Xin.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.860
That's Master's order.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.210
I dare not disobey.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.420
You really...

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:57.010
Alright then.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.530
When I first came up the mountain,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:01.620
he lectured me every day:

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.580
"Rise with the sun,
work hard and study diligently."

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:05.970
And now look,

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.530
he's slacking off himself.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.530
What a cheat.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:11.250
Fine.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:13.260

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.240
She's gone?

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.470
She's far away now. Master, rest assured.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.380
I wonder where she gets all that energy,

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:36.100
dragging us along

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.820
to reflect 3 times a day
and concoct medicine with her.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.450
Tell me,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.070
how long has it been
since I last slept in?

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.440
I...

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.840
Thanks for your generous teaching, Master.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.140
This little trick
of moving without a sound—

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.470
have I mastered it well?

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.210
You've nearly worn out
all the ancient books here.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.620
What exactly are you looking for?

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.050
I just want to know—

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.100
if the Jade Linglong is so dangerous,

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.050
why keep it in this world

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.310
to bring endless harm?

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.380
The Jade Linglong
can greatly enhance one's power.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.910
Its existence isn't wrong.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:45.970
What's wrong lies with those
who harbor ill intent

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.140
and want to use its power

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.400
to do terrible things.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.940
But this kind of power

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.660
requires another person

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.320
to pay the price with his life.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.430
That can never be a good thing.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.340
I'm wondering

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.010
if there's any way

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.690
to break the backlash
between the shadow puppet

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.100
and the blood master.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.940
You can keep talking,

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.270
but don't stop working.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.330
Honor your word. Pay your debt.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.050
At this rate,

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:26.540
how long will it take you

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.219
to finish pounding 1,000 bundles of herbs?

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.820
My medical skills are exceptional.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.010
I can bring the dead back to life.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.900
I can also
argue with the King of Hell for a soul.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.010
In yesterday's contest,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.570
the topics were child's play.

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.100
I simply didn't care to win.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:42.260
Child's play?

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:46.050
Do you have any idea
ailments like presbyopia, tooth decay,

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.820
back pain, diarrhea,

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.420
and menstrual cramps—

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.900
though not critical—

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.030
are exactly
what ordinary people suffer from most?

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.250
If they're so common,

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.340
surely remedies already exist
among the people.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.860
The existing prescriptions among them

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.860
can only ease symptoms.
They can't cure them.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.570
Backed by the resources
of the Wuling Mountain,

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.450
instead of focusing on
curing rare diseases,

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.050
you're obsessed
with studying common ailments.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.510
Isn't that a waste of time?

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.450
As long as my prescriptions are accurate

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.490
and work quickly enough,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:21.820
it's not a waste of time.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.900
Stop wasting time

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.960
and keep pounding.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.170
You can bring the dead back to life.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.740
I can help people
live free of pain and illness.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.270
Both are worthy of respect,

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.310
don't you agree?

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.260
These are all common herbs.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.650
Even for research purposes,

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.450
you surely don't need this many.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.540
Just pound the herbs.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.260
Honor our bet first.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.170
I...

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.900
have my own plans.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.530
I'm the master.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:12.490
Naturally, I need to know

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.750
where the herbs in my mountain are going.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.530
You're hiding it from me.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:18.660
You're becoming more and more unruly.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.740
When I first came up the mountain,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.050
you didn't teach me all these rules.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.620
You spoiled me yourself.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:57.690
Just pound the herbs.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.480
I'm going to eat...

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.030
To take a nap.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.220
From now on,
every time we do something together,

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.620
we'll plant a new flower,

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.050
until the mountain is covered
with flowers.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.510
They'll be our witnesses.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.090
What do you think?

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.500
Prince Annan.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.410
The Empress Dowager
went to Li Shuang's villa.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.570
The Empress Dowager went there?

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.170
Yes.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.780
I'm afraid they might be conspiring

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.250
against you.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.280
Prepare a meal box.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.700
I

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:05.970
will deliver it to Li Shuang myself.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:07.090
You can't do that.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:10.820
If we don't give her the opportunity,

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.880
how can we watch her dig her own grave?

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.370
Duan Aodeng is warmongering and ruthless.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.450
Without someone to control him,

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.300
he will never cease war easily.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.750
Do you really want to see this world

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.740
drown in blood

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.010
and endless war?

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.250
This is called the Brain-Devouring Powder.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.670
It can help you

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.530
get rid of Duan Aodeng.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.430
Have your wounds improved?

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.960
Prince Annan, don't waste your time.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.460
I will not sign the letter of surrender.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.540
What is the meaning of this?

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.050
I'm worried
you might find dining alone dull.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.610
I've had a long day,

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:04.130
so I don't want to bother

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.130
to eat elsewhere.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:07.650
Sit.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.820
It seems something is missing.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:31.740
Guards.
