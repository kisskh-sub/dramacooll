WEBVTT

00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:08.281
Don't you think we should just go back?

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:09.814
We'll get caught.

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:11.335
No way.

00:00:11.335 --> 00:00:14.300
It's my first date with you, after all.

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:17.192
Besides, it's fine.

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:20.578
I've actually been here for work before.

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:23.097
So, if anything happens, I can just ask for help.

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:42.280
Come, Matsuri.

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:01.779
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Amazing.

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:04.481
- So cute!
- So pretty.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.797
It's really cute, right?

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:09.680
­

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.428
I watched a show here
for the first time when I was a kid.

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:15.902
Haruka and Rihito were with me.

00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:17.347
Really, is that so?

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:18.879
Yeah.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.635
And I was really fascinated by it.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.920
They looked so cool as they performed
and had all eyes on them.

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:35.653
I wanted to be someone
who can captivate others like that.

00:01:37.607 --> 00:01:39.930
And that was that?

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:42.931
Yes.

00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.924
That's probably what inspired me
to become an idol.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.090
Wow...

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.928
Excuse me.

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:54.415
Yes?

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:58.716
I know it's very impolite to ask for such a thing.

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:04.248
But the actor playing the prince in today's show
is unwell.

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:07.024
We're having trouble finding a substitute.

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:09.657
Ah, alright.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.182
Huh?

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:15.790
Oh, never mind. I'm really sorry.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.710
I don't mean to cause you trouble.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.617
Please ignore what I said.

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:23.302
I'll do it.

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:24.893
If you'll take me.

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:27.198
Would you, really?

00:02:30.888 --> 00:02:34.278
Want to watch me perform the role of prince?

Watch me closely.

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:41.699
I'll show you who's the coolest prince
in the world.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.221
Okay.

00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:48.071
I apologize for the trouble
during your precious time with your sister.

00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:49.817
Right.

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:54.630
May I ask for one selfish favor
in exchange for doing this?

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:08.572
No, no, no!

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:13.409
Let's go, Matsuri!

00:04:17.228 --> 00:04:20.651
You should be the one performing. Why me?

00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:42.595
Look at their faces.

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:45.267
Wow! It's Cinderella!

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:48.872
A prince and a princess!

00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:55.903
Is this the world you guys always see?

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:59.776
Yes, it is.

00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:05.327
I don't know of any view better than this.

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:23.143
I like you.

00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:29.355
I have feelings for you...

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:35.655
not as a sister, but as a romantic...

I wanted to hear your confession
all the way through, but I couldn't wait.

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:12.553
I love you.

00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:45.890
Oh no, I accidentally said it.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.334
I've lost my mind.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.203
And also...

00:06:55.072 --> 00:07:00.730
Oh no!

00:07:07.682 --> 00:07:09.602
Good morning.

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:14.729
Good morning, I'm heading to school early.
See you!

[Come to the nurse's office]

00:08:35.843 --> 00:08:37.493
Finally, you came closer.

00:08:37.493 --> 00:08:40.660
Wait, were you pretending to sleep?

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.404
And that note?

00:08:43.404 --> 00:08:46.095
Why are you trying to run away?

00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:48.330
Because...

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.553
At least tell me why.

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:52.101
Because it's not working like a normal romance.

00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:53.620
What?

00:08:54.101 --> 00:09:00.257
We aren't like an idol and a fan,
nor like siblings.

00:09:01.072 --> 00:09:04.429
I don't know how to talk to you.

00:09:06.323 --> 00:09:10.167
How long have you been a fan of Terzetto?

00:09:10.774 --> 00:09:12.153
Huh?

00:09:13.526 --> 00:09:18.749
Since your debut, about three years.

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:22.104
And a month since we became siblings.

00:09:23.205 --> 00:09:25.084
Yup.

00:09:25.084 --> 00:09:27.532
But as a couple, just one day.

00:09:27.532 --> 00:09:32.621
So, one month ago,
just like when we first became siblings,

00:09:33.097 --> 00:09:37.362
let's start over from a distance
just close enough to hold hands.

00:09:43.312 --> 00:09:46.277
We can take it slow, Matsuri.

00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:50.402
Nice to meet you again.

00:09:54.643 --> 00:09:56.027
Look at me.

00:10:10.883 --> 00:10:14.631
This much is just fine.

00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:27.968
Matsuri!

00:10:30.816 --> 00:10:32.654
See you.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:46.141
I'm sorry.

00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:48.854
I remember you.

00:10:48.854 --> 00:10:50.933
You are the...

00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:54.302
If you don't want to be
on the cover of a weekly magazine,

00:10:54.302 --> 00:10:59.962
hang out with me, will you, little sister?

00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:03.814
Huh?

00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:08.939
You're Misuzu Yamato, the dancer and idol, right?

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:10.594
Why do you have that photo of us?

00:11:10.594 --> 00:11:12.375
I'm glad you know about me.

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:14.020
Nice to meet you, new student.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.383
Could you please delete that photo?

00:11:17.383 --> 00:11:19.336
You're desperate, huh?

00:11:22.106 --> 00:11:29.202
Wow, the cool second son of Terzetto, Azusa,
is dating his sister. Oh my...

00:11:29.202 --> 00:11:31.726
That's not true!

00:11:31.726 --> 00:11:34.260
Azusa is my brother.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.450
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.100
What would it take for you to delete it?

[PRISM]

We're going to make our debut.

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.677
So what?

00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:54.741
Subaru, he...

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.806
He's completely into you, right?

00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:01.905
What?

00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:03.703
I'm so interested.

00:12:03.703 --> 00:12:10.763
I wonder how impressive you must be
to make our top ace so captivated.

00:12:12.522 --> 00:12:13.830
So...

00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:17.963
Let's pretend to be a couple.

00:12:17.963 --> 00:12:20.202
- What?
- Let's go.

00:12:21.432 --> 00:12:23.415
Is it fun?

00:12:23.415 --> 00:12:25.095
Not really for me.

00:12:25.095 --> 00:12:27.943
I'm having fun.
Do you need to use the restroom?

00:12:27.943 --> 00:12:28.975
No, I'm fine.

00:12:28.975 --> 00:12:32.410
Yamato, why are you with this transfer student?

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:35.721
This girl? She's my girlfriend.

00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:38.615
And the little sister of Terzetto.

00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:41.476
Hey, Yamato.

00:12:41.476 --> 00:12:42.873
- That girl is Terzetto's sister?
- Ah, I made a mistake.

00:12:42.873 --> 00:12:45.002
- I said it, sorry.
- So it's true.

00:12:45.002 --> 00:12:47.164
But aren't their genetics too different?

00:12:47.164 --> 00:12:49.000

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.434
Honey.

00:12:50.434 --> 00:12:52.457
Hey, honey.

00:12:53.726 --> 00:12:59.226
This had to happen right when
I was thinking about making friends.

00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:07.926
Here you are, honey.

00:13:07.926 --> 00:13:09.990
This guy is bad news.

Hey! What's this?

00:13:16.381 --> 00:13:18.336
Aren't we dating?

00:13:18.336 --> 00:13:23.196
Pretending as lovers with me
seems pointless, doesn't it?

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:25.297
Yeah, you're right.

00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:29.253
It's probably not as fun as I expected.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.751
This "pastime".

00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:34.208
Jeez!

00:13:34.208 --> 00:13:37.510
Hey, stop it already and delete the photos.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.030
Because you're the girl Subaru likes,

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:44.390
I thought I might at least have a good time.

00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:49.939
Of course.

00:13:49.939 --> 00:13:55.840
Giving a good time isn't an easy task.

00:13:56.594 --> 00:14:02.697
But idols like you can do it, so you are special.

00:14:02.697 --> 00:14:04.915
Because you are good entertainers.

00:14:06.344 --> 00:14:10.687
Only idols can do something like that.

00:14:13.365 --> 00:14:15.177
You're alright.

00:14:15.904 --> 00:14:20.770
Your secret got out and I made fun of you,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.580
and you still compliment me like that?

00:14:26.037 --> 00:14:27.846
Huh?

00:14:33.094 --> 00:14:36.062
Well, that was unexpected.

00:14:40.328 --> 00:14:42.756
I feel a bit embarrassed.

00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:48.965
I see, you think idols are special, huh?

00:14:53.888 --> 00:14:56.072
Fine, I'll delete it.

I don't really understand, but it's all right.

00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:14.111
While we're at it, should I give you a chance?

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.417
A chance?

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.930
Say, would you like to make an appearance in the music video

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.260
for our debut song?

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.495
What are you talking about?

00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:29.094
The director was looking for a girl.

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.839
Someone ordinary like you.

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:34.965
Should I recommend you?

00:15:35.908 --> 00:15:37.608
What?

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.429
Don't you want to prove everyone wrong?

00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:44.655
Everyone at school.

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:51.570
And why would you want me at all?

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.271
It's weird for someone like me to
show up in your video, don't you think?

00:15:55.271 --> 00:16:00.603
Sorry for spilling your secret,
but you understand, right?

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.267
Understand what?

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:12.190
The reason for silly gossip is being surrounded by princes,

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.990
but not being able to be one.

00:16:21.353 --> 00:16:22.985
Give it a try.

00:16:22.985 --> 00:16:24.952
Isn't this a good chance?

00:16:35.844 --> 00:16:38.830
Being the co-star in Prism's music video...

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.458
Yeah.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:44.517
Don't worry, I'll turn down Subaru for you.

00:16:45.082 --> 00:16:49.887
Actually, this didn't come from Subaru at all.

00:16:51.016 --> 00:16:55.210
Besides, I want to give it a try.

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.411
Why? You don't need to.

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:03.177
Because if I do, I'll just embarrass myself?

00:17:03.177 --> 00:17:05.280
No, that's not it.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.895
Azusa, I feel like I can't just stay like this.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.590
I've realized that

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:17.810
I can't be proud of
being the Terzetto sister as I am now.

00:17:27.517 --> 00:17:32.401
And why would you choose
the Prism music video for this out of all?

00:17:33.263 --> 00:17:39.006
I've never thought of you as ordinary.

00:17:43.308 --> 00:17:45.683
So even if it's not what I want,

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:51.264
just go for it, if that's how you feel.

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:56.087
Thank you.

00:17:56.898 --> 00:18:00.220
Hey, what are you sneaking around for?

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.428
I heard about it.
It's a big deal for my sister.

00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:05.476
Let's cheer for her.

00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:13.993
I'm going to be really worried about you,
you know.

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:17.357
Don't worry, nobody is going to devour me.

00:18:17.357 --> 00:18:21.500
Well, I'm not so sure about those Prism folks.
Who knows what they'll do?

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.192
Wish I could just keep you here safely forever.

00:18:25.192 --> 00:18:28.363
But Matsuri, do your best.

00:18:28.363 --> 00:18:33.974
Don't forget, you're important to us.

00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:37.827
Yup.

00:18:44.517 --> 00:18:47.823
This might be foolish.

00:18:47.823 --> 00:18:52.633
But I want to be someone suitable for Terzetto.

00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:56.512
And I want to match up to Azusa.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.689
Hey.

00:18:59.662 --> 00:19:03.479
- You're here.
- You're our partner, you know?

00:19:04.403 --> 00:19:07.213
Despite being an amateur,
you took it on really well.

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:09.288
Huh?

00:19:09.288 --> 00:19:11.305
You're so naive.

00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:14.438
But don't worry about it.

00:19:14.438 --> 00:19:17.100
I won't be mean today.

00:19:18.643 --> 00:19:20.345
I'll see you later.

00:19:23.642 --> 00:19:25.818
He's a demon!

00:19:25.818 --> 00:19:28.986
Matsuri, are you okay?

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:30.573
Subaru!

00:19:30.573 --> 00:19:35.023
We'll take the lead,
so all you have to do is just be there.

00:19:35.023 --> 00:19:36.627
Thanks.

00:19:36.627 --> 00:19:39.910
I'll give it my best.

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:47.999
Don't forget that I'm the one
you love the most in the world.

00:19:48.827 --> 00:19:51.394
What? Hold on.

00:19:51.394 --> 00:19:54.257
Let's go and kill it out there.

00:20:04.712 --> 00:20:08.979
Here's to our princess.

00:20:15.444 --> 00:20:20.092
You guys playing the princes
compete for the princess.

00:20:20.092 --> 00:20:24.935
Let all the girls experience the moment
of being wooed by their favorite idol

00:20:24.935 --> 00:20:26.650
with all the passion on the screen.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.200
Let's make it an absolutely sensational debut!

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.256
Ready, start!

00:20:40.923 --> 00:20:42.827
I love you.

00:20:45.964 --> 00:20:49.685
Come here, my princess.

00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:54.257
You prefer quiet ones, don't you?

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.940
Be mine?

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.974
And in return, I'll give you everything of mine.

00:21:02.607 --> 00:21:04.722
Hello, princess.

00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:10.319
Your heart must be racing right before a kiss.

00:21:16.973 --> 00:21:18.645
I love you.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:25.327
Cut! OKay.

00:21:25.327 --> 00:21:27.762
- Great job!
- Thanks for the hard work.

00:21:29.318 --> 00:21:32.132
Hey, thanks.

00:21:32.132 --> 00:21:33.854
You did well.

00:21:33.854 --> 00:21:36.477
Your composure surprised me.

00:21:37.002 --> 00:21:39.672
Thank you for doing this for Prism.

00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:44.489
No, thank you all very much.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.723
Matsuri.

00:21:47.293 --> 00:21:49.290
Subaru.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.166
I'll come get you in real life too.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.531
It's finally done.

00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:02.510
- Tired?
- Yeah, I was nervous.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.247
I see.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:13.951
I'll work hard to become a girl
who is worthy of you.

00:22:16.052 --> 00:22:22.759
Just like I always find you so cool,

00:22:23.403 --> 00:22:30.850
I want to become the kind of girl

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.690
who makes your heart race.

00:22:40.261 --> 00:22:45.860
You don't know the real reason I didn't
want you to be in the music video, do you?

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.268
What?

00:22:48.193 --> 00:22:51.826
You don't need to be everyone's princess.

00:22:53.043 --> 00:22:57.120
It's enough if I'm the only prince for you.

00:23:04.886 --> 00:23:08.659
I love you, Matsuri.

00:23:08.659 --> 00:23:15.630
(credits)

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.520
Listen carefully.

00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:22.900
The debut CD sales record
held by Terzetto has been broken.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.309
- What?
- Huh?

00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:28.348
By whom?

00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:33.500
It's Prism.

00:23:34.862 --> 00:23:37.134
It's way ahead.

00:23:37.134 --> 00:23:42.227
At this rate, Terzetto will be replaced by Prism.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.800
­

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.389
It's flawless.
[Prism's fresh faces in full swing!]

00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:53.677
You're seriously going at it.
[Prism's fresh faces in full swing!]

00:23:53.677 --> 00:23:55.942
I'm not planning to give up on Matsuri.

00:23:55.942 --> 00:23:58.253
Take a good look at me now.
[Subaru and Matsuri, getting closer. What's next?]

00:23:58.253 --> 00:24:00.406
A hot spring trip as an appreciation party.
[A thrilling hot spring trip]

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:01.819
What?
[Unexpected unisex bathing experience?]

00:24:01.819 --> 00:24:05.020
Please don't go back to being an idol yet.
