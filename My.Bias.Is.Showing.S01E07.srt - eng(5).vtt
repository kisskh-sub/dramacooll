[My Bias is Showing?!]

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.420
That day,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.750
nothing happened between us.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.120
I know.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.130
I was just overthinking things.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.900
I didn't want it to be hasty

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.870
and forgettable.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.680
I hope our first kiss

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.150
will linger on

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.390
in your memory.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.020
Jooha?

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.370
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.210
I didn't know you'd have a guest.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.800
Hello.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.930
I'm...

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.490
He's the person I'm seeing.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.680
Oh...

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.660
I'm Na Aejoon.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.880
I'm Yeon Jooha.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.760
I used to live here.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.730
Sorry?

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.740
The place was put up for rent,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.079
but he moved in
and didn't change the password.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.900
He said it's too troublesome.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.770
Oh, I see.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.600
He'll be a guest on my radio show
in a few days,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.490
but he isn't even aware
of the script changes.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.620
That's why I came to give this to him
on behalf of the manager.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.230
Please forgive this intrusion.
It won't happen again.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.700
Oh, no, it's okay.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.370
After all, you two are much closer.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.160
Well, being close and being in love
are different.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.090
Alright, enjoy your time together.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.340
See you again sometime.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.680
And I'll see you at the radio studio,
Mr. Choi Siyeol!

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.500
Wow.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.040
I actually saw Yeon Jooha up close.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.000
Sit down.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.460
Let's talk about us again.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.190
It's quite late already.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.190
Why don't you stay over?

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.560
What?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.390
[Episode 7:
I Want to Know If You Feel the Same Way]

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.090
What do you mean
the idol I've been obsessed about

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.650
is my boyfriend?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.260
We even spent the entire weekend together.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.020
I think I forgot how to breathe.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.570
By the way,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.740
I know you're strict with your diet,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.810
but you really only eat salads.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.890
Oh... It's okay. I'm used to it.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.140
But I think it's really impressive.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.270
They say celebrities
all watch what they eat,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.540
but it must be tough
to be so disciplined.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.920
Oh, well... I guess.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.850
So impressive.
You're such a professional!

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.750
Gosh.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.250
Well, it's no big deal.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.250
Um, by the way,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.630
can't you stay over today too?

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.280
We can go to work together tomorrow.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.810
But don't you have a shoot tomorrow?

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.900
I don't want to be a hindrance.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.510
I'm working now too.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.370
What?

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.840
Being disciplined and only eating salads.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.470
I'm working now too, you know?

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.650
Please.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.580
Just stay one more night, okay?

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.340
I'll make you delicious salad
tomorrow morning then.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.460
What are you doing?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.840
This is so embarrassing.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.300
Just kill me now.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.800
Wait. So you were eating it secretly
because of what I said?

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.840
Stop laughing at me.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.230
The thought of you

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.030
sneaking out to buy instant noodles
and eating it secretly

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.770
is just too funny.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.640
You could've just said
you were craving instant noodles.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.100
Eat up.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.970
Are you okay?

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.480
Water.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.490
So cute.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.740
Not that I didn't know...

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.250
but you really do have a cute side.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.810
Are you okay?

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.670
Want more water?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.410
Are you okay?

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.830
Sometimes,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.380
life hits you with a curveball.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.630
But as they say,
sunshine always comes after the storm.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.640
Stay calm and overcome
the approaching adversity.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.070
Like the afternoon sunshine,

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.330
let's have another brilliant day today.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.860
Welcome to "Afternoon Melody."
I'm your host, Yeon Jooha.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.130
Let's welcome our guest today,

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.200
the ever-popular group, A-One!

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.820
Hello, everyone.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.410
Hello, I'm Choi Siyeol of A-One.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.810
Hello, I'm JJ,
the all-round leader of A-One.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.270
Hello, I'm Kyutae, the rapper of A-One.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.360
[Ji Kyusung, are you at
the radio studio now?]

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.350
[Yeah, why?
I didn't see you all weekend.]

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.430
[I doubt you're asking for autographs.]

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.670
[I want to get there
by the end of the broadcast.]

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.690
[You were together all day,
but you already miss him?]

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.970
[No. I want to come clean to Siyeol
before we take things further.]

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.040
[Come clean about what?
That you were his longtime fanboy?]

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.440
[What? I wasn't a fanboy...]

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.850
[I was just... a fan.]

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.130
[It's stupid that I'm hiding
that we're relatives.]

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.110
[It's like I'm always lying to him.]

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.010
[It's about time I be honest with him.]

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.980
[Dude, it's not a big deal.
Don't get all serious.]

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.950
[I'll send you the address.
Call me when you arrive.]

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.530
Let's check out if
that's the correct answer.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.090
Drumroll...

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.830
Sorry, that was incorrect.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.020
Kyutae's the top scorer so far.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.190
Last but not least, Siyeol,
want to give it a go?

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.900
Of course.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.020
I'm the ace of the group.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.620
Wow, very confident.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.470
Alright. Let's have our next caller.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.400
Hello, this is
Yeon Jooha's "Afternoon Melody."

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.280
I'm...

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.160
Holy crap!

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.730
Aren't you Choi Siyeol?

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.990
Yes, I'm Choi Siyeol.

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.900
Hello.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.790
It's really Choi Siyeol!

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.780
It's really him, you idiot!

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.670
Give it to me! Hey!

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.900
-Hello?
-Give it to me!

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.570
Um, excuse me.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.370
You must be a fan of A-One.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.460
Are you on the line?

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.530
Hello?

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.240
Yes, I'm listening.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.660
I'm not a fan.
I'm just calling for the gift.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.940
Right, so here's the question
you have to answer to get the gift.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.930
By the way, are A-One members
still on good terms with Yeon Jooha?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.870
Sorry?

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.590
Didn't he betray A-One

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.540
by suddenly leaving to become an actor?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.900
What the hell?

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.460
That's why A-One's debut was postponed

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.300
and their image was totally ruined,
all because of him.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.580
Is it even possible to stay friends
with a traitor like that?

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.950
-Hey, this is not—
-Hold on.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.870
If you wanted to be an actor,
why join the group in the first place?

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.800
That's so selfish.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.900
Please end the call.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.680
Hang on.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.960
Please end the call now!

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.910
Honestly, I'm more objective

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.950
[Say that the time's up and end the call.]

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.670
because I'm not a fan.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.070
His ankle injury was also

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.060
just a fake excuse to stop the backlash,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.310
wasn't it?

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.870
A fake excuse to stop the backlash?

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.980
Sorry, due to time constraints—

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.030
So, are you saying

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.640
you'd risk your life
just to cover up something like that?

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.100
Have you ever thought about

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.510
how much consideration and resolve
it takes

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.880
to make such an important decision?

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.040
What? What did you say?

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.180
This is the first time
I'm mentioning this to the public.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.170
Yeon Jooha's leg injury...

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:30.370
was because of me.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.640
Should I cut it off?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.230
Wait.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.950
At the time of the incident,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.220
it was only revealed that

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.070
Yeon Jooha, a debut-group trainee,
injured his leg.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.270
Since he wasn't famous back then,

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.240
news reports were all
based on our agency's statement.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.060
[9 years ago]

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.260
Guys, I'm here.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.630
It was a road we crossed every day.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.350
Hurry up!

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:06.560
I was beside Jooha then,
when we were crossing the road.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.880
If only the drunk driver
didn't speed toward the crosswalk...

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.560
If only I shielded Jooha
from the collision...

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.540
instead of the other way around...

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.180
Then maybe

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.840
Yeon Jooha would've debuted with A-One.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.840
What the...

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.550
So, please don't ever
make such careless judgements again.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.330
If anyone tries to slander Yeon Jooha,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.710
I'll take corresponding measures

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.810
to rectify the situation.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.790
Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.420
Seriously... So melodramatic.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.820
Thank you so much
for joining us today, A-One.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.940
Thanks for tuning in.
Until next time.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.440
Hey, Choi Siyeol!

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.920
Come with me.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.720
Why did you mention that on the show

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.170
without approval from the agency?

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.880
The public should know.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.910
Jooha was insulted because of me.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.630
Do you understand
the implications of your words

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.510
and how many people it affects?

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.030
It was an accident.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.020
Yes, but Jooha didn't have to
be the one to get hurt.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.900
Why?

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.800
Since A-One is gaining traction,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.170
are you worried that
this will ruin our image?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.910
Hey.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.270
I've been meaning to ask you this.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.400
Do you like Yeon Jooha?

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.390
Yes.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.480
At this point,

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.240
this is what you're concerned with, huh?

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.240
You found a new man
and abandoned Yeon Jooha.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.410
What, now you regret it?

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.370
Hey, Choi Siyeol!

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.310
If that's not it,

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.240
leave Jooha alone.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.720
Stop giving him false hope.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.760
What about Na Aejoon?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.130
Why are you dating him?

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.030
You... knew about it?

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:22.849
You knew your boyfriend was
dating someone else, but you...

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.859
you were just condoning it?

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.480
What?

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.480
Boyfriend?

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.760
What the hell are you doing?

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.810
Can you make up your mind
and commit to one person?

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.680
So, are you saying...

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.420
you hit on Na Aejoon because you think

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.850
he and I are dating?

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.850
Yeah.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.400
I hope you'll end up with

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.400
no one by your side.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.820
Are you insane?

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.670
Na Aejoon.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.780
Na Aejoon.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.740
Was it your plan all along?

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.890
Answer me, Choi Siyeol.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.300
[Epilogue]

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.100
Hey, the trailer of
"Go! School Teacher" is out!

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.230
Wow, interesting.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.300
You're right.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.990
Why?

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.590
Is something wrong?

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.340
No, well...

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.330
There are a lot of comments.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.900
I don't want you to become famous.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.290
I thought it was something serious.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.990
Do you see this?

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.660
They're already asking for your IG handle.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.820
He's so handsome.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.080
What's your IG handle?

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.170
Please check your DMs.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.780
Mr. Na Aejoon looks totally like an idol.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.290
Even if he switches roles
with Choi Siyeol,

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.690
he'd fit the role.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.990
[Choi Siyeol,
math teacher at Nabit High School]

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.070
It's really good!

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.980
Look at how he chews his food.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.320
He's so freaking cute!

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.490
Seriously, how can he be so cute?

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:58.030
First, go to the teachers' office
and start streaming his new song.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.930
You saw me getting out!
How could you just open your door—

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.880
[Na Aejoon,
rookie idol]

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.870
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.180
Did I hurt you?

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.080
Is he... angry?

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.280
But he's so handsome.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.280
He is...

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.400
a million times cuter in person!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.710
It's Na Aejoon!

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.230
Settle down. Be quiet.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.840
From now on, call him Mr. Na Aejoon.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.000
Show some respect.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.030
Sit down.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.010
Okay.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.670
Are you okay?

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.500
Yes, thank you.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.690
From now on, if you need anything...

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.150
just let me know.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.320
Okay.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.280
This setting has its charm too...

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.450
It's appealing too.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.440
[In the next episode]

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.290
I should've known that something was off

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.900
by how interested he was in me.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.250
Was anything between us real?

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.900
I wanted to steal the man
Kyusung was seeing from him.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.220
Are you okay?

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.210
Hello, Jooha.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.880
Are you a reporter?

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.410
Have you broken up with
the person you were seeing?

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:35.580
Sorry?

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.200
What do you mean you have to drop out

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.380
of this project, Mr. Na?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.100
I don't mean I'm dropping out right now.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.260
Wait.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.530
Let's talk.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.510
What else is there to talk about?
