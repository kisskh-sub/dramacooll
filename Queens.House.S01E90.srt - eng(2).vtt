00:00:01.195 --> 00:00:02.465
(Episode 90)

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:24.115
What do you think you're doing?

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.385
A kidnapping? What's wrong with you?

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.185
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:32.355
How can you not know?

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:34.095
I don't know! I just don't!

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.165
I think I can't live without you.

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:41.765
I can't stand seeing you with some other guy!

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:46.635
I guess I'm still in love with you.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:57.385
"Love?"

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:00.585
How dare you even say that word?

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:02.085
Have you forgotten...

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:04.295
what you did to me?

00:01:05.095 --> 00:01:06.095
How can you...

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.495
say something like that so shamelessly?

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:12.365
Jae In.

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:21.705
Don't say my name like that. It makes me sick.

00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:27.445
- Let's talk... - Don't you dare say "love."

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.585
I gave you my everything.

00:01:31.615 --> 00:01:34.225
I loved you unconditionally.

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:39.355
And who was it that brutally stomped all over that love?

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.125
It was you!

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:43.725
Tell me.

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:46.365
To me, the woman who loved you...

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:48.905
To my family...

00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:50.435
To my dad...

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:52.505
To our Eun Ho...

00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:55.305
Just what did you do?

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:05.655
Until the day you die,

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:10.925
you don't have the right to say the word.

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:46.325
Bo Ram, did you have a nice evening walk with your uncle?

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:47.625
Yes.

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:51.865
But where we went is a secret.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:58.175
Did you take her somewhere nice?

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:00.105
She's grinning from ear to ear.

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:02.275
Just the park.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:04.175
I see...

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:06.845
She seems happy just being with her uncle.

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:09.685
You must be tired. Thanks for taking her.

00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:10.755
Go on in and get some rest.

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:13.015
Okay. You get some rest too, Mom.

00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:33.075
Hello? Jae In?

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:35.775
- Yes. - Where are you?

00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:37.075
Are you okay?

00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:38.845
I just got home.

00:03:39.675 --> 00:03:42.245
How's Bo Ram? I'm worried she was scared.

00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:44.915
I talked her through it, so she's fine.

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:47.755
That's a relief.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.355
Jae In, are you really okay?

00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:54.965
Don't worry. Nothing happened.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.995
Okay, get some rest then. I'll see you at work tomorrow.

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:00.565
Okay.

00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:01.835
See you tomorrow.

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:24.995
I think I can't live without you.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.495
I can't stand seeing you with some other guy!

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:29.865
I guess...

00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:31.795
I'm still in love with you.

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:01.025
What were you doing that made you so late?

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:02.425
It's none of your business.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.535
Where have you been with Jae In?

00:05:05.535 --> 00:05:07.365
I called Driver Kim to confirm.

00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:10.665
He said you drove off with Kang Jae In yourself.

00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:12.675
So what were you two doing?

00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:14.345
Are you a stalker?

00:05:15.275 --> 00:05:18.045
I don't have to report to you, so knock it off.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:20.815
What do you mean you don't have to?

00:05:20.845 --> 00:05:22.785
We're married. Or did you forget?

00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:51.275
Mom, I'm home.

00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:54.445
Who are you?

00:05:57.145 --> 00:05:58.285
Mom, it's me.

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:00.115
Seung Woo. Your son.

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:04.455
Are you Seung Woo?

00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:06.895
I am.

00:06:09.095 --> 00:06:11.795
Oh, right. My son, Seung Woo.

00:06:13.995 --> 00:06:15.865
You should dress a little neater.

00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:18.275
Your father won't be happy if he sees you.

00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:21.945
Okay.

00:06:23.345 --> 00:06:24.845
What's all this?

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:27.645
I know you love fruit.

00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:29.415
I went and bought some at the market.

00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:33.315
You're always so thoughtful, Seung Woo.

00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:35.985
Jae In could learn a thing or two from you.

00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:40.725
Mom.

00:06:41.065 --> 00:06:43.025
I'm running late. I have to get to work.

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:44.635
To where?

00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:46.095
Did you get a job?

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:48.105
I did.

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:49.735
When I get paid this month,

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:51.535
I'll buy you a new outfit.

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:54.545
Just hearing you say that makes me happy.

00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:11.155
Did you have a nice visit with your mother?

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:13.125
Yes.

00:07:13.955 --> 00:07:15.625
You'll be late for work. Go on.

00:07:20.295 --> 00:07:21.305
How have you been?

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:23.235
Great.

00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:24.775
Hurry up and go.

00:07:25.435 --> 00:07:26.735
I'll head out then.

00:07:37.555 --> 00:07:41.055
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:07:45.895 --> 00:07:47.325
What do you think you're doing?

00:07:48.195 --> 00:07:51.265
Don't you dare lay a hand on Jae In again.

00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:55.865
Dragging her off like that against her will is a crime.

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:00.105
And who do you think you are?

00:08:00.805 --> 00:08:02.205
This is between Jae In and me.

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:04.575
- Stay out of it. - Because...

00:08:06.345 --> 00:08:07.815
I have feelings for her.

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:12.455
Don't you think that gives me the right to interfere?

00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:17.055
I can't stand by and watch you mistreat the woman I love.

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:21.195
Especially from you, a man Jae In despises.

00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:22.965
That gives me all the more reason to stop you!

00:08:25.265 --> 00:08:26.765
Stay away...

00:08:27.705 --> 00:08:28.705
from Jae In.

00:08:38.975 --> 00:08:39.975
"The right?"

00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:42.545
That crazy jerk.

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:52.555
Tae Ho?

00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:56.895
The more I look at him, the more I'm sure I've seen him before.

00:08:58.665 --> 00:08:59.935
Where could I have seen him?

00:09:02.065 --> 00:09:04.235
Right, that's it. The painting.

00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:08.105
He's the guy who came to the gallery looking for Choi Ja Young.

00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:11.715
So what's he doing in my house?

00:09:15.085 --> 00:09:16.085
Where are you going?

00:09:17.545 --> 00:09:20.315
Me? I was just going to go play in the garden.

00:09:21.385 --> 00:09:22.525
I told you that you're not allowed.

00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:24.184
I told you that if you went to the mall again,

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:25.525
I was going to tie you up.

00:09:26.095 --> 00:09:28.365
Mom, you're a genius.

00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:30.365
How did you know? I didn't even say anything.

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:32.865
This is so frustrating.

00:09:33.295 --> 00:09:35.265
Why, of all things, did he have to hurt his head...

00:09:35.535 --> 00:09:37.365
just to drive me this crazy?

00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:43.605
I've carefully reviewed the contract from DH Holdings.

00:09:44.075 --> 00:09:45.075
Oh, you have?

00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:47.415
So, have you made your decision?

00:09:48.545 --> 00:09:51.255
I'll sign the contract as soon as my project with Tae Ho is complete.

00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:54.325
That's a wise decision.

00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:57.185
But won't you need an office to work with Tae Ho?

00:09:57.525 --> 00:10:00.825
After the YL Group project ends, I plan on looking for a studio.

00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.195
Tae Ho is already looking into it.

00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:06.095
Why go to all that trouble? You can just work here, right?

00:10:07.035 --> 00:10:10.335
Yes. You'll be one of our designers soon.

00:10:10.465 --> 00:10:11.475
So, of course, you can.

00:10:12.235 --> 00:10:13.275
Would that be all right?

00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:15.245
By all means.

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:17.745
I would love to see you every day.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.245
Yes.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.885
- Excuse me. - Come on in.

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:26.515
I'm here to see you, Jae In.

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:30.255
Someone at Planning and Design told me that I could find you here.

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:34.494
Actually, I was about to call you. We were just discussing an office.

00:10:34.495 --> 00:10:37.995
Mr. Jung kindly suggested we share an office.

00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:39.895
What do you think?

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:41.764
It's fine with me.

00:10:41.765 --> 00:10:43.705
If you're comfortable, let's do that.

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:46.675
Shall we step out for some coffee?

00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:48.205
Sure.

00:10:48.945 --> 00:10:49.945
We'll be on our way, then.

00:10:57.715 --> 00:10:59.585
Se Ri, say hello.

00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:01.655
This is Lee Tae Ho, an art dealer.

00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:03.155
I know.

00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:05.395
Gi Chan and I have met him before.

00:11:06.795 --> 00:11:08.825
What were you doing coming out of that office?

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:11.365
I was here to meet with Designer L.

00:11:11.895 --> 00:11:15.365
She accepted my project proposal, so we're going to work together...

00:11:15.505 --> 00:11:16.705
with Designer L.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.335
So you'll be working here from now on?

00:11:20.605 --> 00:11:21.645
Shall we go?

00:11:28.945 --> 00:11:32.655
As if home wasn't enough, now he's here to suffocate me here?

00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:39.995
I hope the gallery becomes a space that conveys deep historical truths,

00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:43.725
while also captivating the audience.

00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:49.965
I'll keep that in mind and tell you once I have a concrete concept.

00:11:50.465 --> 00:11:51.535
Sounds good.

00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:55.805
Oh, are you really okay with sharing the office at DH Holdings?

00:11:56.175 --> 00:11:58.075
If it's inconvenient, we can look for another place.

00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:02.215
Coming from my Lady Luck, of course, it's fine.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:07.755
Please don't call me that. It's really embarrassing.

00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:09.555
Why not?

00:12:09.785 --> 00:12:11.895
You look like one to me.

00:12:23.835 --> 00:12:26.105
May I ask a personal question?

00:12:29.805 --> 00:12:30.805
Sure.

00:12:34.445 --> 00:12:35.785
It's about Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

00:12:36.885 --> 00:12:38.655
I heard he was your ex-husband.

00:12:41.985 --> 00:12:44.555
I'm curious about his family.

00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:48.065
I also heard that the new Director of JY Gallery...

00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:50.625
is Chairman Hwang's mother.

00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:57.165
Search for "Exposé World" on the online video platform.

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:03.045
That will tell you everything you need to know about him...

00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:07.345
as well as Kang Se Ri.

00:13:32.575 --> 00:13:33.605
Hello.

00:13:35.505 --> 00:13:36.845
What brings you here again?

00:13:38.075 --> 00:13:39.875
I was meeting with Designer L.

00:13:41.145 --> 00:13:42.985
I believe we're done here.

00:13:44.015 --> 00:13:45.015
I'll see you around.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:47.315
Okay.

00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:52.025
Designer L.

00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:53.655
Can we talk if your meeting is over?

00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:07.905
Say what you need to say.

00:14:09.675 --> 00:14:10.875
Did you get home safe last night?

00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:14.745
Is that why you wanted to see me? To ask that?

00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.515
Didn't Kim Do Yun say anything?

00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:21.425
What did you do to Do Yun?

00:14:21.685 --> 00:14:22.885
Did you threaten him or something?

00:14:23.755 --> 00:14:25.355
He's the one who threatened me...

00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:27.055
and assaulted me.

00:14:29.095 --> 00:14:30.495
He grabbed me by the collar...

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:33.565
and threatened me to stay away from you.

00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:39.875
Good. He said what I've been wanting to say.

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:42.645
Who does he mean to you?

00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:44.775
What's going on between you two?

00:14:45.945 --> 00:14:47.575
Are you really going to date him or something?

00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:50.985
What if I am?

00:14:52.685 --> 00:14:53.785
Kang Jae In.

00:14:55.055 --> 00:14:57.185
Don't lie. Just tell me the truth.

00:14:58.095 --> 00:14:59.095
Are you dating him?

00:14:59.325 --> 00:15:00.455
I asked if you're dating.

00:15:01.425 --> 00:15:02.525
Answer me.

00:15:05.235 --> 00:15:07.335
I have no obligation to tell you.

00:15:07.795 --> 00:15:10.605
You can think whatever you want.

00:15:34.525 --> 00:15:37.565
I heard you had dinner at CEO Jung's house yesterday.

00:15:38.595 --> 00:15:39.695
How was it?

00:15:40.235 --> 00:15:44.165
Honestly, I was a little intimidated when he suddenly invited me over.

00:15:47.075 --> 00:15:49.305
But it was nice to have a lively meal...

00:15:50.245 --> 00:15:51.545
with everyone after so long.

00:15:53.545 --> 00:15:55.515
Back when my father was alive,

00:15:56.515 --> 00:16:00.615
he always made sure the whole family ate together.

00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:04.995
But back then, I just thought, "Dad is so old-school."

00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:07.195
That's all I used to think.

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:11.165
But I was wrong.

00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:14.235
Looking back on it now,

00:16:15.335 --> 00:16:16.705
even with our busy lives,

00:16:17.905 --> 00:16:20.005
at least we could face each other at the dinner table

00:16:20.335 --> 00:16:21.575
and talk about our day.

00:16:24.345 --> 00:16:25.975
I realise now how precious that time was.

00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:30.015
It was, wasn't it?

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:32.815
It makes me think of your father.

00:16:40.425 --> 00:16:41.565
Seung Woo.

00:16:42.165 --> 00:16:44.995
The other day, when we stopped by Director Do's house,

00:16:45.195 --> 00:16:47.365
we talked about something while you were asleep.

00:16:49.665 --> 00:16:50.665
Did you overhear all of it?

00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:54.075
Yes.

00:16:55.145 --> 00:16:56.145
Oh, you did.

00:16:58.075 --> 00:17:00.045
Well, let's skip the backstory then.

00:17:02.345 --> 00:17:04.345
About your biological father...

00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:09.385
You were worried he might be married and have a family.

00:17:09.455 --> 00:17:12.125
And I remember you said you were on the fence about it.

00:17:14.895 --> 00:17:15.925
He is...

00:17:16.895 --> 00:17:18.395
still not married.

00:17:21.705 --> 00:17:24.205
You've been in touch with him?

00:17:27.335 --> 00:17:29.345
Seung Woo, if you're okay with it,

00:17:30.345 --> 00:17:33.715
I was thinking of arranging for you two to meet.

00:17:36.045 --> 00:17:37.085
Okay.

00:17:38.255 --> 00:17:39.955
But not right away.

00:17:41.985 --> 00:17:43.925
It's not that I don't want to meet him.

00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:45.895
It's just an awkward situation.

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:50.925
Okay, we'll take it slow.

00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:11.415
This is nice.

00:18:11.416 --> 00:18:13.215
What? We have to toast! Cheers!

00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:18.755
Ji Ho loves toasting too.

00:18:18.895 --> 00:18:21.995
We always do a little toast, even with water or juice.

00:18:23.565 --> 00:18:24.565
Oh, really?

00:18:26.735 --> 00:18:28.264
I couldn't help but notice at dinner...

00:18:28.265 --> 00:18:30.605
that you took such good care of Ji Ho.

00:18:30.835 --> 00:18:33.035
Is it just because he's your son?

00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:38.815
I've always felt a little guilty when it comes to Ji Ho,

00:18:39.175 --> 00:18:40.714
so I try to give him extra attention,

00:18:40.715 --> 00:18:41.845
even with the little things.

00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:43.815
Sorry for what?

00:18:44.445 --> 00:18:48.385
Well, from the moment Ji Ho was conceived to when he grew up,

00:18:48.855 --> 00:18:51.555
I had to travel back and forth between Korea and the U.S.

00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:54.725
So I spent a lot of time away from him.

00:18:55.825 --> 00:18:59.935
But he grew up so healthy and well. I'm so proud of him for that.

00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:04.635
So you were living between the U.S. and Korea.

00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:10.175
I had business matters that I had already established in Korea,

00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:12.345
and there were a number of other things going on.

00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:16.385
Besides, we actually hadn't planned on having children.

00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:18.785
In fact, just a year before we had Ji Ho,

00:19:19.185 --> 00:19:21.925
we'd even talked about how we were better off without kids.

00:19:32.135 --> 00:19:36.565
Take it from me, Mr. Lee. If you marry, you should have kids.

00:19:37.765 --> 00:19:38.875
How should I put it?

00:19:39.935 --> 00:19:42.545
It gives you a reason to keep going, you know?

00:19:44.675 --> 00:19:45.715
Is that so?

00:19:57.485 --> 00:19:59.455
Should I get you some honey tea?

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:01.595
Get out.

00:20:30.525 --> 00:20:31.555
Are you crazy?

00:20:31.825 --> 00:20:34.355
What if someone sees you? What are you doing in Ji Ho's room?

00:20:34.595 --> 00:20:36.325
And this is okay? The two of us, alone like this?

00:20:37.365 --> 00:20:40.735
- Lee Tae Ho. - You met your husband after me?

00:20:41.035 --> 00:20:42.035
That's right.

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:44.305
Unbelievable.

00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:48.445
Every word that comes out of your mouth is a lie.

00:20:48.505 --> 00:20:49.575
It's true.

00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:52.075
Just a year before Ji Ho was conceived,

00:20:52.615 --> 00:20:54.544
you said it was better without kids.

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.285
That's what your husband told me.

00:20:57.385 --> 00:21:00.415
- Well, that's... - A year before conceiving Ji Ho?

00:21:01.255 --> 00:21:03.625
That was before you and I had even met.

00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:06.995
That just means you were two-timing me.

00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:10.965
- Tae Ho, wait... - I'm done listening to your lies.

00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:15.235
Before I tell Chairman Hwang Gi Chan and this entire family everything,

00:21:16.005 --> 00:21:17.235
send Ji Ho to me.

00:21:18.805 --> 00:21:19.805
Tae Ho.

00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:38.425
(YL Group)

00:21:42.465 --> 00:21:43.465
Let's talk.

00:21:59.275 --> 00:22:00.445
Just tell me what you've decided.

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:01.945
So, am I taking Ji Ho?

00:22:02.345 --> 00:22:05.155
You want to be a dad now?

00:22:06.085 --> 00:22:07.455
Since when have you been a father to him?

00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:09.355
You're the one who didn't let me be a father!

00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:11.725
That's because I didn't know you were his father!

00:22:14.655 --> 00:22:18.265
Fine. I was seeing both you and Gi Chan.

00:22:19.035 --> 00:22:21.465
Gi Chan was usually away in Korea, and I was lonely.

00:22:22.265 --> 00:22:24.205
You were there for me, and you helped me get through it.

00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:28.505
I swear I didn't know Ji Ho was your son.

00:22:29.605 --> 00:22:31.575
I just assumed he was Gi Chan's son.

00:22:32.145 --> 00:22:33.315
That's why I left you.

00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:36.515
I'm so sorry for deceiving you,

00:22:37.415 --> 00:22:39.755
but I truly believed Ji Ho was Gi Chan's son.

00:22:39.885 --> 00:22:41.585
I don't want to hear your excuses.

00:22:42.585 --> 00:22:45.325
All I want is my son.

00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:47.355
What is wrong with you?

00:22:48.095 --> 00:22:49.925
Don't you care about his happiness at all?

00:22:50.525 --> 00:22:53.065
Would you make him miserable out of your own selfishness?

00:22:53.595 --> 00:22:54.595
Really?

00:22:57.035 --> 00:22:58.975
If you really care about Ji Ho, then stop this.

00:22:59.605 --> 00:23:01.535
Everything I'm doing is for Ji Ho's sake.

00:23:02.705 --> 00:23:05.275
Tae Ho, please. I'm begging you.

00:23:07.775 --> 00:23:09.985
Or are you just using Ji Ho to get what you want?

00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:13.955
If you're the one who really wants what's best for Ji Ho,

00:23:14.355 --> 00:23:15.355
then you'll send him to me.

00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:17.185
I can't give you much time.

00:23:17.825 --> 00:23:18.855
Make up your mind quickly.

00:23:25.765 --> 00:23:29.605
You keep showing up at home and work just to torment me!

00:23:29.865 --> 00:23:31.665
Go back to the U.S. right now!

00:23:47.455 --> 00:23:48.455
Aren't you going to ask?

00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:50.785
It's a private matter.

00:23:53.955 --> 00:23:56.265
I told you I was staying with an acquaintance, remember?

00:23:57.695 --> 00:23:59.295
Well, I'm at Chairman Hwang's house.

00:24:01.735 --> 00:24:04.305
I guess he is in a real hurry.

00:24:04.905 --> 00:24:07.575
Maybe he's in a position where he has to sell the painting quickly.

00:24:08.205 --> 00:24:10.545
I made one offhand comment about wanting to see a Korean home,

00:24:11.345 --> 00:24:14.215
and he immediately offered to let me stay at his place.

00:24:14.715 --> 00:24:15.785
And that's how it happened.

00:24:16.945 --> 00:24:19.255
Didn't you and Kang Se Ri use to date?

00:24:21.355 --> 00:24:22.555
That was a very long time ago,

00:24:23.885 --> 00:24:25.255
and Chairman Hwang doesn't know.

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:27.625
You won't tell him, will you?

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:31.025
It's not my place to get involved.

00:24:31.765 --> 00:24:35.565
But I have to admit I'm not sure what to make of this.

00:24:36.735 --> 00:24:37.735
Me too.

00:24:39.275 --> 00:24:40.975
I've been pretty confused myself lately.

00:24:44.105 --> 00:24:46.675
Oh, thank you for your help with the toy.

00:24:47.915 --> 00:24:49.885
Ji Ho is Chairman Hwang's...

00:24:52.515 --> 00:24:53.815
He's Se Ri's son,

00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:57.354
and thanks to you, I think I got him something...

00:24:57.355 --> 00:24:58.525
he really loves.

00:24:59.055 --> 00:25:00.395
He absolutely loved it.

00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:15.605
Yes, Oh Seong.

00:25:16.845 --> 00:25:18.775
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.

00:25:20.315 --> 00:25:22.845
What's money when it comes to our love?

00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:26.215
For me, love comes first.

00:25:27.215 --> 00:25:30.125
And first is money, second is money, and third is money.

00:25:30.885 --> 00:25:34.655
If a man is rich, he's a walking wallet.

00:25:38.095 --> 00:25:42.905
For me, love is first, love second, and love third.

00:25:44.435 --> 00:25:47.905
By any chance, could I borrow your house tonight?

00:25:49.275 --> 00:25:51.505
- My house? - Yes.

00:25:51.775 --> 00:25:54.645
I've recently made a rather large donation,

00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:56.915
and a newspaper wants to interview me about it.

00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:00.585
I mean, I'm the CEO of a global investment firm,

00:26:00.955 --> 00:26:03.655
but I haven't had a chance to secure a proper home here in Korea yet.

00:26:04.325 --> 00:26:06.395
They'll be taking pictures during the interview,

00:26:06.555 --> 00:26:08.495
and your place looks so impressive.

00:26:08.765 --> 00:26:10.725
Please? It would be a huge help.

00:26:11.725 --> 00:26:13.395
Of course, you can.

00:26:13.965 --> 00:26:16.505
Anything for you, Oh Seong.

00:26:16.765 --> 00:26:17.805
Come on over.

00:26:18.365 --> 00:26:21.035
My home is your home.

00:26:22.005 --> 00:26:23.705
You're more than welcome.

00:26:24.875 --> 00:26:26.445
Great. I'll see you later.

00:26:29.385 --> 00:26:31.515
Should I use this as an excuse for him to move in with me?

00:26:33.215 --> 00:26:36.485
No, marriage has to come first, though.

00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:39.295
Don't tell me...

00:26:39.355 --> 00:26:42.165
Is he lying so he can propose?

00:26:43.425 --> 00:26:46.895
Gosh, I should be fully prepared, just in case, right?

00:26:48.095 --> 00:26:49.765
Should I run to the salon?

00:26:53.275 --> 00:26:54.405
So, what'd she say?

00:26:54.805 --> 00:26:57.105
She's all, "You're more than welcome!"

00:26:57.745 --> 00:26:59.375
And that seals the deal.

00:26:59.945 --> 00:27:02.345
It took everything I had to keep from breaking out in hives.

00:27:03.615 --> 00:27:05.715
You really went through it.

00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:08.385
Are you ready for this?

00:27:08.785 --> 00:27:11.755
Of course. I'm going to hit them where it really hurts.

00:27:11.925 --> 00:27:13.655
And you squared things away with Yun Hee?

00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:16.465
Yes, we agreed to meet there later.

00:27:17.925 --> 00:27:19.135
I'm going to see Jae In now.

00:27:22.635 --> 00:27:25.205
I was just thinking I missed Bo Ram, so this is perfect.

00:27:25.735 --> 00:27:27.005
Don't worry about Bo Ram.

00:27:27.405 --> 00:27:28.775
I'll take great care of her.

00:27:29.775 --> 00:27:30.775
Thank you.

00:27:31.305 --> 00:27:33.515
Don't be silly. It's the least I can do.

00:27:33.815 --> 00:27:36.385
We'll make dinner, eat, and play together,

00:27:37.185 --> 00:27:39.555
so don't worry about a thing and just go nail it.

00:27:44.055 --> 00:27:45.625
You're stopping by the salon on your way, right?

00:27:46.655 --> 00:27:49.995
Yes, the kids told me to dress to kill.

00:27:51.825 --> 00:27:53.765
Finally, the day of reckoning is here.

00:27:55.195 --> 00:27:56.205
I guess it is.

00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:01.075
I'm dying to see the looks on their faces.

00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:03.675
Make sure they get what's coming to them.

00:28:04.305 --> 00:28:05.415
I'll be rooting for you.

00:28:05.975 --> 00:28:06.975
Thanks.

00:28:07.945 --> 00:28:09.445
Oh, I'll make sure they get what they deserve.

00:28:26.835 --> 00:28:29.135
- I'm here. - Welcome.

00:28:29.865 --> 00:28:31.305
Oh my, Oh Seong.

00:28:31.565 --> 00:28:33.775
You look so dashing today.

00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:35.375
Goodness.

00:28:39.945 --> 00:28:40.945
Wait...

00:28:41.615 --> 00:28:42.685
These people...

00:28:43.615 --> 00:28:46.685
Wait, what are they all doing here?

00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:48.984
Did I forget to mention?

00:28:48.985 --> 00:28:51.285
I made the donation in my sister's name.

00:28:55.495 --> 00:28:56.895
Thanks for letting us use your home.

00:29:01.195 --> 00:29:02.235
You've got a nice place here.

00:29:03.735 --> 00:29:04.735
Way beyond your means.

00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:15.175
Thank you.

00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:33.395
What is all this? You didn't say a word to me.

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:36.805
No, I just...

00:29:37.435 --> 00:29:39.535
I thought it was just going to be Oh Seong.

00:29:40.505 --> 00:29:44.405
All right, let's get the big check and take a proper photo.

00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:45.775
Yes, let's do that.

00:29:46.245 --> 00:29:47.615
Go ahead and give it to them.

00:29:48.915 --> 00:29:49.915
Right.

00:29:50.445 --> 00:29:51.715
(Fire Orphan Scholarships, 6 Million Dollars)

00:29:51.785 --> 00:29:52.785
Here you go.

00:29:53.185 --> 00:29:54.285
Okay, a round of applause!

00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:04.725
No way, she donated all that? Wait, how many zeros is that?

00:30:04.895 --> 00:30:07.465
Okay, let's see... A thousand, a million...

00:30:08.965 --> 00:30:10.005
Six million?

00:30:11.235 --> 00:30:12.735
What? Six million?

00:30:15.275 --> 00:30:16.445
It really is.

00:30:17.345 --> 00:30:19.345
Wait a second. Six million...

00:30:20.845 --> 00:30:23.515
Hold on. That's the exact amount I lost in that real estate fraud.

00:30:27.715 --> 00:30:31.125
Leave it to the money-crazed bitch to be quick on the uptake.

00:30:31.425 --> 00:30:35.055
What was that? "A money-crazed what?"

00:30:35.495 --> 00:30:37.125
Are you just that dense?

00:30:37.495 --> 00:30:38.935
Can't you read the room?

00:30:39.335 --> 00:30:40.335
You see it and still don't get it?

00:30:40.565 --> 00:30:41.665
Darn it.

00:30:41.865 --> 00:30:43.435
What do you mean I don't know?

00:30:43.765 --> 00:30:46.535
The six million you blew on that land deal...

00:30:47.605 --> 00:30:50.175
This is it! You con artist!

00:30:51.375 --> 00:30:53.045
What? Oh, my goodness!

00:30:54.545 --> 00:30:55.545
Oh, no.

00:31:49.505 --> 00:31:53.635
(Queen's House)

00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:55.644
Why did you have to fall down the stairs?

00:31:55.645 --> 00:31:57.075
Look at this mess.

00:31:57.575 --> 00:31:59.845
Mom, I wasn't going down the stairs.

00:32:00.145 --> 00:32:02.845
- I was pushed. - Oh, not this again.

00:32:03.345 --> 00:32:04.385
But it's true!

00:32:05.585 --> 00:32:07.785
Right? You pushed me.

00:32:08.355 --> 00:32:11.985
Actually, I only just found out you have a son.

00:32:12.795 --> 00:32:13.795
A son?

00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:15.725
You mean Mr. Lee's son?

00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:17.125
If I were to have regrets...

00:32:20.465 --> 00:32:21.465
I do have regrets.

00:32:23.165 --> 00:32:24.165
I, too,

00:32:26.105 --> 00:32:27.535
deserve to love you.
