00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.650
Normal life to others

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.050
is an unknown world to me.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.360
Everything is a first experience,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.710
and everything feels unfamiliar.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.170
Will there ever be a day
I can fit into this world?

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.510
There's no one here?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.910
Do you live around here?

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.830
I've never been here before.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.539
Do you know the huge church around here?

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.840
If you go further from there...

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.370
Your eyes are quite special.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.960
Are you okay...

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.270
I'm not interested.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.570
What?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.979
I'm not interested in your religion.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.460
Go do your missionary work elsewhere.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.830
I'm not feeling well today.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.100
Think of it as saving me.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.340
The weather is really bad.

[A mask that gives you bright white skin]
[Vampire-like white skin modeling pack]

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.440
What's with this blood pack?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.550
Is it going to expire?

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.950
Even so, you should drink it sparingly.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.600
It's hard to get good stuff these days.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.260
I heard there'll be substitute food soon,
so let's just hold out.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.800
Wanna have this instead?

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.720
The substitute would taste better
than blood, right?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.510
It's the closest to human blood.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.360
I'll eat this later.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.280
I worked out today.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.540
Touch it.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.680
Get lost!

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.329
Friends can do that too.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.149
Do you only do online shopping at home?

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.950
None of your business.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.780
What is this?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.490
That's mine. Don't touch it.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.280
Where did you go?

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.680
What's wrong with him?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.480
I don't know. Let's go upstairs.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.030
What happened?

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.440
No idea. Let's just go upstairs.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.960
I'm worried.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.010
Let's go upstairs.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.110
Mr. Han Dongha.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.110

If you have any questions,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.690
consult the housekeeper, Joowon.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.740
By the way,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.880
my brothers are socially awkward

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.880
but they are

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.510
nice people.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.840
Try getting along with them
for the month.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.640
Is anyone home?

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.340
Why is it so dark? Is there no one?

[Lee Okhee]

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.310
Hello, Okhee.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.370
What? Who's coming?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.190
Hey! Who are you?

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.880
I'm sorry!

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.800
I'm not feeling well today.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.250
Think of it as saving me.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.680
Are you

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.100
the one who stole my umbrella?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.130
You're... that cultist?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.010
-What happened?
-What happened?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.620
My name is Han Dongha.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.640
I came early because I have
a part-time job interview

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.720
I've got to go to.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.440
I told the landlady.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.620
But it seems like
she didn't inform you tenants.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.230
What landlord? What tenant?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.150
Do you think I'll fall for your tricks?

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.320
Hey!
You're the one who stole my stuff first.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.920
There's no end to this.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.500
Do you carry a cross with you?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.850
It's prohibited in this house.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.850
Take that with you and get out.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.320
Wow, even accusing me?

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.720
I'm not a cultist, I'm a tenant moving inâ€“

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.090
We didn't get a new tenant.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.890
Get out while I'm being nice.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.630
Okhee. What brings you here?

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.040
Mr. Han Dongha?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.190
Yes.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.140
Nice to meet you.

Get along well for the following month.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.680
Okay.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.420
Answer me.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.560
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.050
Okhee.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.250
You didn't discuss with us beforehand.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.289
Let's talk.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.419
If you don't like blood,
then just eat your medication.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.000
Why don't you listen?
That's why you keep fainting in the sun.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.240
Are you rebelling?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.640
I didn't faint. I just almost fainted.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.430
Never mind.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.660
No more drawing of curtains,

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.820
and you must take your medication
before going out.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.050
If you don't listen,
I'll kick all of you out.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.010
Why?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.120
You did say when there are substitutes
you'd go to university, right?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.700
You have a month left.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.910
You need to start adjusting to it.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.750
Are you sure
I can eat that substitute?

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.640
Are you questioning my research ability?

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.630
That's not what I meant.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.770
I'm not pure-blooded like them.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.390
There might be side effects.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.720
Half-bloods like you can eat

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.940
my substitute food too.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.760
Don't worry about that.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.020
Fine.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.670
Then what's with him?

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.500
We were doing fine, so why?

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.300
During my time,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.890
we lived well together,
building a town during Gyeongseong.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.620
But now?

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.430
There are surveillance cameras everywhere.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.730
Even old ladies from the countryside are
doing live streaming.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.840
Do you think it makes sense for you to
not communicate with humans at all?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.820
Huh?

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.150
Stop building up that wall
and accept the reality.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.850
They're just humans.
What's the big deal?

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.690
Gosh, you are so troublesome.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.840
Okhee.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.000
Sehee. I told you I changed my name.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.840
Whatever.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.420
Don't blame me if I suck his blood.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.690
Goodness.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.280
You don't even want to drink blood,
drinking it only once in a while.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.860
Suck his blood?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.470
Anyway, you can't eat him,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.490
so give up on that thought
and get along well with him.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.060
But don't like him too much.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.350
So you're not a cultist?

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.770
Do you believe in other religions

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.660
or dream of becoming a pastor?

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.380
Do you like garlic?

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.340
Do you have good eyesight?

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.460
I don't believe in religion.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.830
About garlic... Why do you ask?

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.150
Well, I'm just curious.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.670
Let's get along.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.320
-Let's get along.
-Let's get along.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.690
Just for a month, right?

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.500
Yes.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.320
There's one thing you must obey.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.240
Don't interfere
with each other's private lives.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.560
If you break that, you'll be kicked out.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.240
What's your so-called private life scope?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.200
If possible,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.480
try not to contact the tenants here.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.890
It's better not to be friendly.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.450
Do we have that rule?

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.900
I just made it a rule.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.550
There's another one.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.160
There's another tenant here.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.120
Don't look at him.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.770
You two, follow me.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.120
What's wrong with him today?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.160
Do you need to ask?

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.820
Of course it's cause he's
low on hemoglobin.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.500
What's wrong with him?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.060
What are you doing up at this hour?

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.640
I'm not good at
sleeping in unfamiliar places.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.490
Even the air in Seoul is different.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.760
I've been living in the countryside.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.490
It's my first time in a big city.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.070
But you can see the stars
really clearly there.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.630
Oh, right. You're going to enter
Hanguk University, right?

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.530
The landlady told me.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.010
But, my umbrella...

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.440
This is for the umbrella.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.130
That's not what I meant.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.150
Let's keep a distance from each other.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.750
I just want to ask if you feel better.
