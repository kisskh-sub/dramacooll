00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:11.318
(Cool waves welcome people...)

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:14.688
(at the relaxing beach.)

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:19.127
(Which place did the Iron Girls visit?)

00:00:19.128 --> 00:00:20.328
(Cheering)

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:22.927
Hello.

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:24.457
Hello.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.968
(Making a big fuss)

00:00:26.098 --> 00:00:28.168
(The Iron Girls are especially excited.)

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:30.537
- Hello. - This is great.

00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:31.867
- Isn't it like a foreign country? - Yes.

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:34.137
We're in a foreign country.

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:35.608
Welcome to Phuket.

00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:39.348
- It's my first time in Phuket. - I love it.

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.278
(Iron Girls in Phuket, Thailand)

00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:50.488
(The center of Southeast Asia, Thailand)

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:59.598
(Phuket is a vacation spot that represents Thailand.)

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:07.768
(What are the Iron Girls doing in Phuket?)

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:09.207
It's so cool.

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:10.537
We aren't in Korea.

00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:12.247
- Isn't it great to be at the sea? - It's totally cool.

00:01:12.248 --> 00:01:13.878
We really are in a foreign country.

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:15.577
It's totally cool.

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:16.777
- Aren't we going to play? - What?

00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:17.778
Aren't we going to play?

00:01:18.648 --> 00:01:21.417
(That's right. We came all the way to Phuket.)

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:23.087
This is what I want to tell you guys.

00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:25.788
We came here to play. Why are we here?

00:01:25.888 --> 00:01:28.458
(Will it be the first vacation for the Iron Girls?)

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:30.928
We came here to play,

00:01:31.158 --> 00:01:32.678
but you might run out of breath a bit.

00:01:32.798 --> 00:01:35.037
You might put something on your hands.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:37.067
You might put something on like gloves.

00:01:37.068 --> 00:01:38.567
But you can play.

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:42.538
However, you have 10 days until your 1st competition.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:44.278
Your 1st competition is in 10 days.

00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:45.707
I'm scared.

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:47.508
- Okay. Let's just train. - That's right.

00:01:47.548 --> 00:01:49.147
The thing is, Phuket...

00:01:49.148 --> 00:01:50.417
- is well-known for Muay Thai. - Yes.

00:01:50.418 --> 00:01:53.217
Thus, the sports infrastructure is great.

00:01:53.218 --> 00:01:55.858
Athletes from all over the world come here.

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:57.918
Many martial arts athletes come here.

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:03.898
(When you think of Phuket, the emerald-colored beaches...)

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:09.768
(and the relaxing atmosphere of a vacation come to mind.)

00:02:12.108 --> 00:02:16.008
(But there's a different side of Phuket.)

00:02:16.838 --> 00:02:18.907
(Thanks to the weather that's warm all year round...)

00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:20.548
(and good sports infrastructure, )

00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:23.847
(Phuket is the go-to place for off-season training...)

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:26.218
(for martial arts athletes around the world.)

00:02:28.558 --> 00:02:34.428
(Captain Dong Hyun visits the place often for training.)

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.898
Athletes set up a camp before a competition.

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:40.927
- "A camp?" - We need to train hard...

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:43.698
and have a good match.

00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:47.238
Thus, the theme of this Phuket trip will be the Iron Boot Camp.

00:02:48.308 --> 00:02:49.378
"Boot camp?"

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:52.807
(Boxers around the world...)

00:02:52.808 --> 00:02:56.348
(challenged the Iron Girls.)

00:02:56.648 --> 00:02:58.517
(With only 10 days remaining until the competition, )

00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:00.418
(they will have their last full sparring.)

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:04.888
(There's no place to escape.)

00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:08.088
(What will be the result of the fierce match?)

00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:13.728
(And who is the special coach who visited them?)

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:16.768
(Is this a dream or reality?)

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:18.137
No way!

00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:19.408
Will I be in the ring with her?

00:03:19.468 --> 00:03:20.568
Am I ready for this?

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:25.148
(A meeting with a world-class boxer is coming soon.)

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:27.678
With the mindset of preparing for a war,

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:30.518
you must participate in the Iron Boot Camp.

00:03:31.118 --> 00:03:32.388
Let's just train.

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:35.587
Iron Girls never give up!

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:37.017
That's right. Can you do well?

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:39.057
- Victory is ours! - Yes.

00:03:39.058 --> 00:03:41.228
- Let's go! - Okay. That's good.

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.128
But what's up with your outfit today?

00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:44.967
Are you going to plant rice?

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:46.268
- Rice planting. - Are you?

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:48.567
Sae Rok, your outfit stands out.

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:49.838
Please.

00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:51.767
I thought we were going to farm.

00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:53.438
- Is that so? - Yes!

00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:55.808
Is there a reason why your socks are blue?

00:03:56.038 --> 00:03:59.078
Wearing the color of my passion, blue,

00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:01.207
I'll defeat the opponent in the red team!

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.247
- You'll destroy the red team? - Yes.

00:04:03.248 --> 00:04:04.417
Here's the red team!

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:05.647
(The red cornder is here.)

00:04:05.648 --> 00:04:08.117
(I'll defeat her.)

00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:09.187
That's great.

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:10.557
- Captain Uie. - Yes!

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:11.627
What do you think?

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:12.988
Just give us food!

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:14.527
Tasty food!

00:04:14.528 --> 00:04:16.627
I want to eat pu pad pong karee!

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:17.628
Same here!

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.067
As soon as you complete the mission,

00:04:19.068 --> 00:04:21.668
tasty food will be provided at all times.

00:04:21.838 --> 00:04:23.637
- All right! - Let's go!

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.568
Now, to the training location!

00:04:25.668 --> 00:04:26.767
Let's move!

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:27.937
- Let's move! - Let's move!

00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:28.978
Let's go!

00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:30.637
- Run! One, two. - One, two.

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:32.208
One, two.

00:04:32.378 --> 00:04:33.507
You aren't here to play.

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:34.778
We aren't here to play.

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.277
We aren't here to play, but we can be in a good mood.

00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:38.818
Let's do this.

00:04:39.088 --> 00:04:40.487
(What?)

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.757
- What's that? - What? What is it?

00:04:41.758 --> 00:04:43.517
- What's that flag? - What?

00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:44.887
(A mysterious skull flag)

00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:45.958
What's that?

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.797
- Someone is standing there. - What?

00:04:48.798 --> 00:04:49.897
- Who is that? - What?

00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:51.097
(Who is standing there?)

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:53.267
- Who is that? - What?

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:54.368
Who is that?

00:04:56.168 --> 00:04:57.337
Be faster, guys!

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:58.607
Let's go! Run!

00:04:58.608 --> 00:05:01.307
- Be faster, guys! Let's go! Run! - I feel like we should run.

00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:02.837
But she's a foreigner.

00:05:02.838 --> 00:05:04.438
I feel like we should run.

00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:06.277
Faster!

00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:08.148
- Faster! - Faster!

00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:09.778
- Run! - What's this?

00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:11.917
(Why are there tires?)

00:05:11.918 --> 00:05:13.018
What's this?

00:05:13.448 --> 00:05:15.858
(There are tires with rope...)

00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:20.228
(and equipment that shouldn't be on the beach.)

00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:23.898
(Something doesn't seem right.)

00:05:24.228 --> 00:05:25.327
What's this?

00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:27.068
(What's this?)

00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:30.698
Hello.

00:05:31.368 --> 00:05:32.507
- Hello. - Hello.

00:05:32.508 --> 00:05:34.207
(Her charisma makes them stutter due to nervousness.)

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:35.877
Hi, my name is Jibby.

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:38.138
I'm a head coach at the Pirate Camp.

00:05:38.278 --> 00:05:39.377
- "Pirate Camp?" - "Pirate Camp?"

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:40.478
What's this?

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:44.118
(Have you heard of exercising abroad?)

00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:47.887
Pirate Camp is a famous exercise program...

00:05:47.888 --> 00:05:49.958
that takes place on the beaches of Phuket.

00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:52.827
To participate in this camp,

00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:55.357
fitness enthusiasts from all over the world...

00:05:55.358 --> 00:05:56.527
come to Phuket.

00:05:56.528 --> 00:05:59.044
(An extreme exercise program for the global fitness enthusiasts)

00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:00.297
It's a fun program,

00:06:00.298 --> 00:06:02.497
so the Iron Girls have to participate.

00:06:02.498 --> 00:06:03.797
I'm scared.

00:06:03.798 --> 00:06:05.337
Do you know why you're here today?

00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:07.368
I want you guys to experience it today.

00:06:08.308 --> 00:06:09.477
- We're in trouble. - Excited?

00:06:09.478 --> 00:06:10.478
- We're in trouble. - Excited?

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.777
- Yes! - Yes!

00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:13.047
Let's go.

00:06:13.048 --> 00:06:14.977
Hold on. If I remember correctly,

00:06:14.978 --> 00:06:17.817
a coach who speaks Korean is coming.

00:06:17.818 --> 00:06:19.748
- Who? - Really?

00:06:20.188 --> 00:06:21.317
Please come on in.

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:25.828
(Where?)

00:06:26.358 --> 00:06:29.158
The coach who speaks Korean is here.

00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:32.268
All right.

00:06:33.168 --> 00:06:35.768
(Taking out)

00:06:36.138 --> 00:06:37.498
(Putting on the pirate do-rag)

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:40.308
The coach who speaks Korean is here.

00:06:40.438 --> 00:06:42.378
- Welcome. - Yes.

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:43.808
Welcome.

00:06:45.908 --> 00:06:47.277
A big surprise.

00:06:47.278 --> 00:06:48.817
- Yes. - I'm a coach.

00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:50.647
I opened a gym in Phuket.

00:06:50.648 --> 00:06:52.517
(The Cicada Gym opened in Phuket.)

00:06:52.518 --> 00:06:53.747
I like the Cicada Gym.

00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:54.847
- It's good, right? - Yes.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.618
I'll assist Coach Jibby and join the program.

00:06:57.658 --> 00:06:59.658
- Okay. - All right. Let's go.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.127
People will come and join you guys.

00:07:03.128 --> 00:07:04.857
Is another team coming?

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:06.598
- Hold on a second. - Players, come on in.

00:07:06.868 --> 00:07:09.298
Pirates, let's go!

00:07:09.698 --> 00:07:12.168
(Oh, my)

00:07:12.468 --> 00:07:13.567
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:13.568 --> 00:07:15.208
- Run! - Oh, my gosh.

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:19.877
(Many healthy and muscular people enter.)

00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:21.048
Look at their bodies.

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:22.717
(Sae Rok freezes and In Ah chuckles.)

00:07:22.718 --> 00:07:23.878
- Hold on. - Gosh.

00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:26.587
- Hello. - Hi.

00:07:26.588 --> 00:07:28.087
It's so global.

00:07:28.088 --> 00:07:29.188
How cool.

00:07:29.388 --> 00:07:31.257
(These incredible people signed up for the Pirate Camp themselves.)

00:07:31.258 --> 00:07:32.358
They're so fit.

00:07:32.658 --> 00:07:34.088
- There's Aquaman too. - Yes.

00:07:34.828 --> 00:07:36.357
(There's someone who looks like Aquaman.)

00:07:36.358 --> 00:07:38.227
You participated in the fitness race...

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:39.327
- last time. - Yes.

00:07:39.328 --> 00:07:41.528
This is the circuit training with similar vibes.

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:43.544
- Will we go around? - It's the circuit training.

00:07:43.568 --> 00:07:45.768
The second is core training.

00:07:45.908 --> 00:07:47.007
- A core training. - Also,

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.248
two people will make up a team.

00:07:48.508 --> 00:07:49.977
If you're exhausted,

00:07:49.978 --> 00:07:51.807
you can switch places with your teammate.

00:07:51.808 --> 00:07:53.678
- There's a time limit. - Okay.

00:07:53.948 --> 00:07:55.277
If you make it back on time,

00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:56.678
you'll receive a gold medal.

00:07:56.878 --> 00:07:58.017
- Yes. - I love that idea.

00:07:58.018 --> 00:07:59.187
- Seriously, - Real gold?

00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:00.417
It'll be like real gold.

00:08:00.418 --> 00:08:01.747
- Okay. - Seriously.

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:02.857
That sounds good.

00:08:02.858 --> 00:08:03.888
- I want it. - Okay.

00:08:04.258 --> 00:08:05.457
(Pirate Camp)

00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:06.528
(Circuit training)

00:08:06.588 --> 00:08:10.857
All right. Let's begin the circuit training in earnest.

00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:11.928
- Okay. - That's good.

00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:13.228
As you can see,

00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:14.867
there are four sections,

00:08:14.868 --> 00:08:16.537
- A, B, C, and D. - Okay.

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.837
Each section has three missions,

00:08:18.838 --> 00:08:19.838
and...

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:22.307
you need to complete them in all four sections.

00:08:22.308 --> 00:08:23.708
(They must complete all 4 courses.)

00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:25.908
Let me explain the first one, Course A,

00:08:25.948 --> 00:08:28.548
Run 200m while pulling a tire.

00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:29.747
What?

00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:30.977
(Running 200m while pulling a tire)

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:33.448
Start from the point with the flags.

00:08:33.488 --> 00:08:34.987
You'll see flags in a distance.

00:08:34.988 --> 00:08:36.457
Make a round trip.

00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:38.957
Two members will pull a tire together.

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.028
Okay.

00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:44.158
Then there's doing 60 deadlifts while holding a 16kg kettlebell.

00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:46.168
Hold on. Did he say 60?

00:08:46.698 --> 00:08:48.097
Then there's doing 60 burpees.

00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:50.167
Touch the ground with your chest and do a standing jump.

00:08:50.168 --> 00:08:51.268
No.

00:08:51.338 --> 00:08:53.107
How will we do 60 burpees?

00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:54.908
Then you'll be done with Course A.

00:08:55.478 --> 00:08:57.138
And the second course...

00:08:58.748 --> 00:08:59.908
Wait. Time out.

00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:03.148
This is a fun exercise. What's that look on your face?

00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:05.647
I just finished explaining the first one, Course A.

00:09:05.648 --> 00:09:06.717
The look on your face...

00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:09.017
You looked happy when you were warming up earlier.

00:09:09.018 --> 00:09:11.388
Your face suddenly fell.

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:13.287
Guys, we have...

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:14.658
ten days until the competition.

00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:16.057
This training will come in handy...

00:09:16.058 --> 00:09:17.328
during the competition.

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:18.497
Also,

00:09:18.498 --> 00:09:19.897
we took a six-hour flight to come here.

00:09:19.898 --> 00:09:21.267
- That's right. - Let's make it worthwhile.

00:09:21.268 --> 00:09:22.748
- Okay. - Let's do our absolute best.

00:09:23.268 --> 00:09:25.707
(Course B)

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:28.367
(Course C)

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:29.737
(Course D)

00:09:29.738 --> 00:09:30.808
That was a work of art.

00:09:31.178 --> 00:09:34.308
This is the most needed training for boxing.

00:09:35.108 --> 00:09:38.047
If you complete all missions in 35 minutes,

00:09:38.048 --> 00:09:39.218
(The cutoff time: 35 minutes)

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:41.017
you'll receive a gold medal.

00:09:41.018 --> 00:09:43.518
We can switch if we get a bit tired.

00:09:43.618 --> 00:09:46.157
Divide into teams as you guys want.

00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:48.087
Let's do it differently from the fitness race.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.157
- Differently. - Then we're together.

00:09:49.158 --> 00:09:50.478
- We're together. - Is this okay?

00:09:50.558 --> 00:09:52.627
- That was easy. - Yes.

00:09:52.628 --> 00:09:54.474
The two members who are standing together will be a team.

00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:55.997
- Are you ready? - Are you ready?

00:09:55.998 --> 00:09:58.368
- Yes! - Yes!

00:09:58.438 --> 00:09:59.468
Okay.

00:09:59.768 --> 00:10:01.568
I want to do it too. It's too bad.

00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:03.428
They put the rope around the shoulder.

00:10:03.638 --> 00:10:04.707
Stand by.

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:06.777
We start in ten seconds.

00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:07.808
Ten seconds.

00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:09.177
(Nervous)

00:10:09.178 --> 00:10:10.547
All right. Let's move it.

00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:11.777
Are we ready?

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.147
- Yes! - Yes!

00:10:13.148 --> 00:10:15.148
I can do it! We can do it!

00:10:15.188 --> 00:10:16.417
(Iron Girls'...)

00:10:16.418 --> 00:10:17.787
(first training...)

00:10:17.788 --> 00:10:18.957
(abroad)

00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.488
Let's go.

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:24.758
(Running 200m while pulling a tire)

00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:26.268
Let's go.

00:10:27.028 --> 00:10:30.298
(They run at full speed.)

00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:35.377
One straight line, guys. Let's go. Parking it there.

00:10:35.378 --> 00:10:38.078
(They run as they pull a tire across the beach in Phuket.)

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:41.478
(It's the best feeling.)

00:10:41.508 --> 00:10:42.648
Amazing.

00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:44.077
That's good.

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.254
(They quickly pass the halfway point.)

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:46.287
Ju Hyun, are you okay?

00:10:46.288 --> 00:10:47.318
I'm okay.

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:50.758
(They work with their partners...)

00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.258
(and run energetically.)

00:10:53.588 --> 00:10:55.527
- We're done. - Very good.

00:10:55.528 --> 00:10:57.128
(They finish the first mission quickly.)

00:10:57.158 --> 00:10:58.258
Next.

00:10:58.298 --> 00:10:59.368
Shall I go first?

00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:02.137
All right. Check the reps for each other.

00:11:02.138 --> 00:11:03.768
Do it for your teammate.

00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:09.638
(Do deadlifts with a 16kg kettlebell.)

00:11:10.178 --> 00:11:14.748
(It's the training for strengthening the core.)

00:11:15.248 --> 00:11:16.318
One,

00:11:16.848 --> 00:11:17.948
two,

00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:19.087
three, four...

00:11:19.088 --> 00:11:22.988
(She maintains the pace she had in the beginning.)

00:11:23.388 --> 00:11:24.917
Uie, will you do all of them? Let's do ten reps each.

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:26.028
You can do the burpees.

00:11:26.188 --> 00:11:27.428
Get ready for the burpees.

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:30.497
Six...

00:11:30.498 --> 00:11:33.368
(This is the class of Stamina Queen.)

00:11:33.668 --> 00:11:35.738
In Ah, that's a great form.

00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:37.814
You're doing it with the correct form.

00:11:37.838 --> 00:11:41.068
(She has the perfect form.)

00:11:41.508 --> 00:11:45.548
(In the other team, In Ah is doing the reps first.)

00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:47.407
Sae Rok, get some rest.

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:48.478
We're doing burpees next.

00:11:50.118 --> 00:11:53.347
(Leave the 16kg kettlebell to Strong In Ah.)

00:11:53.348 --> 00:11:54.387
In Ah.

00:11:54.388 --> 00:11:55.517
Jump.

00:11:55.518 --> 00:11:56.588
Jump a bit.

00:11:57.488 --> 00:11:58.688
- Three. - Jump a bit.

00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:00.758
Let's do ten each.

00:12:01.158 --> 00:12:02.158
One.

00:12:02.498 --> 00:12:07.168
(Doing 60 burpees)

00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:11.638
(Ju Hyun does the burpees first.)

00:12:11.768 --> 00:12:12.768
Five.

00:12:12.908 --> 00:12:16.638
(When Ju Hyun gets tired, Uie switches places with her.)

00:12:19.048 --> 00:12:20.078
(Grunting)

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:22.518
(Breathing hard)

00:12:22.918 --> 00:12:23.947
Three.

00:12:23.948 --> 00:12:25.247
(In Team Sae Rok and In Ah, )

00:12:25.248 --> 00:12:27.088
(Exclaiming Rok begins with the burpees.)

00:12:30.388 --> 00:12:31.717
- Five. - Five each.

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:33.857
(They switch places after 5 burpees.)

00:12:33.858 --> 00:12:36.898
(They proceed with Course A without a hitch.)

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:39.467
Look over there.

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:41.028
The first team began Course B.

00:12:41.528 --> 00:12:42.768
The second team began.

00:12:42.868 --> 00:12:43.868
Next one.

00:12:43.869 --> 00:12:46.368
When you finish your burpees, let's go.

00:12:46.468 --> 00:12:47.508
Let's go.

00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.538
- Go! - Let's go.

00:12:50.408 --> 00:12:52.307
(Ju Hyun sets off with the treasure chest.)

00:12:52.308 --> 00:12:53.908
Go together. Take turns frequently.

00:12:54.078 --> 00:12:55.148
Treasure.

00:12:55.678 --> 00:12:56.778
In Course B,

00:12:57.148 --> 00:12:59.548
you will run 200m, carrying a 15kg treasure chest...

00:12:59.718 --> 00:13:00.847
on your shoulder.

00:13:00.848 --> 00:13:02.758
(Running 200m carrying a treasure chest)

00:13:02.818 --> 00:13:05.787
Squat 80 times holding the 15kg treasure chest.

00:13:05.788 --> 00:13:07.357
(Squatting 80 times holding a treasure chest)

00:13:07.358 --> 00:13:10.998
Third, do 80 lunges while alternating legs.

00:13:11.698 --> 00:13:14.067
You usually work out with sandbags or dumbbells,

00:13:14.068 --> 00:13:15.567
so carrying a box like this...

00:13:15.568 --> 00:13:17.274
makes you use different muscles than usual.

00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:19.508
So this type of training can be helpful.

00:13:20.268 --> 00:13:21.438
Slow down.

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:22.778
We're not in a rush.

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.278
Do you want me to carry it?

00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:25.608
Give me that.

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.048
This is really heavy.

00:13:28.348 --> 00:13:31.178
(It's okay. I'm the Stamina Queen.)

00:13:31.348 --> 00:13:33.087
- Ju Hyun, follow me. - Uie.

00:13:33.088 --> 00:13:34.588
(Running fast, following along)

00:13:35.488 --> 00:13:37.618
- You're really fast. - Let's do this.

00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:39.658
She still has a lot of energy left.

00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:43.558
(Getting to the halfway point quickly)

00:13:44.028 --> 00:13:45.158
Do you want to switch?

00:13:45.398 --> 00:13:47.097
No. Help me put this on my shoulder.

00:13:47.098 --> 00:13:48.168
What?

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:50.137
I think it will be harder this way.

00:13:50.138 --> 00:13:51.198
No, this is better.

00:13:52.268 --> 00:13:54.107
- Uie, give it to me now. - No, we're almost there.

00:13:54.108 --> 00:13:55.368
- Are we? - We're here.

00:13:55.608 --> 00:13:57.608
(As expected, Uie is the tireless Stamina Queen.)

00:13:58.808 --> 00:14:02.048
(She's carrying it for over 100m on her own.)

00:14:03.348 --> 00:14:08.018
(Smiling broadly as if it is not hard at all)

00:14:08.588 --> 00:14:12.628
(Another person who is running with a smile)

00:14:13.088 --> 00:14:16.098
- Good job. Come on. - Go with her.

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:18.657
(The 15kg chest is heavy even for Strong In Ah.)

00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:20.727
Switch. All right?

00:14:20.728 --> 00:14:21.768
Can you carry it?

00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:23.574
It's easier with it on your shoulder.

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:25.067
It will be hard that way. Just do it.

00:14:25.068 --> 00:14:26.348
(They switch at the 100m point.)

00:14:27.238 --> 00:14:29.307
- Good. - Come on.

00:14:29.308 --> 00:14:31.008
You're doing well.

00:14:31.808 --> 00:14:33.407
Will you carry it on your head? Not on the head.

00:14:33.408 --> 00:14:35.618
- My goodness. - Head?

00:14:36.018 --> 00:14:39.418
(Lifting it over her head)

00:14:40.218 --> 00:14:41.317
Watch your head.

00:14:41.318 --> 00:14:43.718
(But it looks like...)

00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:47.658
(A mother carrying a snack to a farm?)

00:14:48.558 --> 00:14:51.297
(Perfect K-labor style)

00:14:51.298 --> 00:14:52.368
Good.

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:53.868
Your head...

00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:55.738
Oh, no.

00:14:56.538 --> 00:14:58.267
(Throwing it down due to exhaustion)

00:14:58.268 --> 00:14:59.714
It's easier to carry it on your shoulder.

00:14:59.738 --> 00:15:00.807
Okay?

00:15:00.808 --> 00:15:02.128
(I will carry it no matter what.)

00:15:02.308 --> 00:15:03.677
Carrying it with your fingers is harder.

00:15:03.678 --> 00:15:06.208
You are using only the difficult ways now.

00:15:07.148 --> 00:15:09.578
- Switch. - Give it to me.

00:15:09.718 --> 00:15:10.718
No.

00:15:10.719 --> 00:15:11.724
(Rocky Keum never gives up.)

00:15:11.748 --> 00:15:13.587
- Let's go! - We're almost there.

00:15:13.588 --> 00:15:15.068
- Let's go, girl. Come on. - Come on.

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:18.088
(She grits her teeth and finishes the course.)

00:15:18.188 --> 00:15:19.427
- Good. - There you go.

00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:22.188
(She squats without stopping, while holding 15kg.)

00:15:22.758 --> 00:15:26.798
(Squatting 80 times holding a treasure chest)

00:15:26.898 --> 00:15:28.498
Sae Rok's legs are stronger now.

00:15:28.598 --> 00:15:30.937
She was too weak to lift things like that before.

00:15:30.938 --> 00:15:32.338
Her legs have gotten stronger.

00:15:33.108 --> 00:15:35.608
- Six, seven. - Good.

00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:36.808
You're doing well.

00:15:37.078 --> 00:15:39.407
We are ten minutes in, guys.

00:15:39.408 --> 00:15:40.708
- Ten minutes in. - Eight.

00:15:40.908 --> 00:15:44.477
- We have 24 minutes left. - She's gotten stronger.

00:15:44.478 --> 00:15:46.817
- Good. Let's do it one more time. - Okay.

00:15:46.818 --> 00:15:48.018
It's 60. The last one.

00:15:48.718 --> 00:15:50.188
Good. You're doing well.

00:15:50.888 --> 00:15:52.787
- Beautiful. - Let's go.

00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:54.528
All right. Squat 80 times.

00:15:55.828 --> 00:15:57.958
(Glancing)

00:15:57.998 --> 00:15:59.098
Perfect.

00:15:59.968 --> 00:16:02.098
(Holding a 15kg box in her arms, )

00:16:02.998 --> 00:16:06.438
(she maintains perfect posture.)

00:16:06.538 --> 00:16:07.608
Nine.

00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:09.337
- Ten. - Ten.

00:16:09.338 --> 00:16:10.408
You're almost there.

00:16:10.508 --> 00:16:13.948
(While In Ah doing squats)

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:15.947
(Look at her.)

00:16:15.948 --> 00:16:17.178
Why are you smiling?

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:19.487
Good. Uie, you are the best.

00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:21.124
(The crazy Stamina Queen is happy doing squats.)

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.657
- She's not tired yet. - Four.

00:16:22.658 --> 00:16:23.758
I'm tired.

00:16:24.688 --> 00:16:25.858
I'm tired but happy.

00:16:27.158 --> 00:16:28.228
Nine.

00:16:28.458 --> 00:16:30.927
(Uie is happy when she works out.)

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:33.167
Five, six.

00:16:33.168 --> 00:16:35.528
- Two, three. - She's doing lunges now.

00:16:36.168 --> 00:16:37.767
(Doing 80 lunges holding a treasure chest)

00:16:37.768 --> 00:16:39.368
- Let's go. - Five.

00:16:39.468 --> 00:16:40.538
You can do this.

00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:41.908
Why are you smiling?

00:16:42.208 --> 00:16:43.708
You are unbelievable.

00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:47.078
In Ah and Uie are strong.

00:16:47.778 --> 00:16:48.778
Let's go.

00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:50.339
- You got this. Keep going. - Let's go.

(The muscle people from all over the world are enjoying the workout.)

00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:57.008
It does feel like I'm in a foreign country.

00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:00.587
(The people who flew in from all over the world to do this.)

00:17:00.588 --> 00:17:02.228
Awesome.

00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:05.458
Go.

00:17:05.528 --> 00:17:07.397
Come on. Push.

00:17:07.398 --> 00:17:08.828
(They truly love exercise.)

00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:09.997
Eight!

00:17:09.998 --> 00:17:11.937
(Mad Uie is happy.)

00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:13.208
Okay.

- I'm fine with this. - You are?

00:17:23.948 --> 00:17:24.948
You can just walk.

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:26.947
(She's happy carrying an 11kg dumbbell.)

00:17:26.948 --> 00:17:29.617
- I'm a strong girl. - You're strong.

00:17:29.618 --> 00:17:31.818
I'm a weak girl. I'm weak.

00:17:32.728 --> 00:17:34.287
Go a little faster.

00:17:34.288 --> 00:17:36.097
(Running 200m carrying a dumbbell)

00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:37.128
Come on.

00:17:37.628 --> 00:17:40.368
- One, two, three, four. - A little to the left.

00:17:40.528 --> 00:17:42.997

- She is a monster. - In front of Uie...

00:17:54.078 --> 00:17:55.177
Do you need a break?

- Are you all right? - Yes.

00:17:57.048 --> 00:17:59.348

- Eight, nine. - You're almost there.

00:18:01.088 --> 00:18:02.517
Forty. One.

One.

- Six. - That's enough.

00:18:13.198 --> 00:18:14.628
Stop it.

00:18:14.728 --> 00:18:16.938
- Hey. Stop it. - That's enough.

(Ju Hyun tries her best not to burden Uie.)

00:18:21.838 --> 00:18:24.807
Uie, for this course, you should keep up with Ju Hyun's pace.

00:18:24.808 --> 00:18:25.908
Of course.

00:18:26.548 --> 00:18:28.347
You're such an amazing person.

00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:29.718
Why? I'm fine.

00:18:29.978 --> 00:18:31.777
I would've told you if I were too tired to do it.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.348
You're unbelievable.

00:18:33.588 --> 00:18:36.318
Instead, I'm not good at things that require strength.

00:18:36.558 --> 00:18:38.988
I can feel that you are doing your best now.

00:18:40.758 --> 00:18:42.287
You are working out your lower body a lot today.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.597

No.

You got this!

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:02.427
We should take a photo of In Ah lying on the ground.

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.467
(Sae Rok and In Ah poured out all their strength.)

00:21:03.468 --> 00:21:05.137
Look at In Ah lying on the ground.

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.178
Thank you.

00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:15.578
Well done.

00:21:15.778 --> 00:21:16.818
You didn't give up.

00:21:17.448 --> 00:21:18.548
You didn't give up.

00:21:19.348 --> 00:21:20.417
Alright.

00:21:20.418 --> 00:21:23.058
(They finished within the time limit with a boxer's spirit.)

00:21:24.888 --> 00:21:25.918
Good job.

00:21:26.388 --> 00:21:27.388
Finished?

00:21:28.028 --> 00:21:29.157
- One more. - Finish!

00:21:29.158 --> 00:21:30.727
- One more? Oh, gosh. - Finish!

00:21:30.728 --> 00:21:32.127
- Go. One more. - Finish.

00:21:32.128 --> 00:21:33.198
We'll die.

00:21:34.298 --> 00:21:36.798
You're evil.

00:21:36.938 --> 00:21:38.297
It's not my problem.

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.738
(Laughing)

00:21:40.938 --> 00:21:42.168
Okay. The last one.

00:21:42.268 --> 00:21:43.537
- Easy? - Very easy.

00:21:43.538 --> 00:21:45.178
She says it's very easy.

00:21:45.408 --> 00:21:47.147
Ready for a six-pack?

00:21:47.148 --> 00:21:49.148
- Yes! - Yes. Let's go.

00:21:49.178 --> 00:21:51.077
We will do it in the water.

00:21:51.078 --> 00:21:52.818
What? What is going on?

00:21:52.888 --> 00:21:54.217
All right. Sit down.

00:21:54.218 --> 00:21:56.288
- Sit here? - One line. Let's go.

00:21:56.688 --> 00:21:58.958
My goodness. What are we doing?

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:02.157
(Sitting facing the sea, they feel great.)

00:22:02.158 --> 00:22:03.928
- Good. - Yes!

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:07.597
(Just looking at the beautiful waves makes them feel refreshed.)

00:22:07.598 --> 00:22:08.927
This training session...

00:22:08.928 --> 00:22:12.137
is available only in Phuket.

00:22:12.138 --> 00:22:13.537
This is the best.

00:22:13.538 --> 00:22:15.378
(The beach of Phuket is perfect for training.)

00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:17.737
Guys, are you glad that you came to Phuket?

00:22:17.738 --> 00:22:19.677
- Yes! - Good.

00:22:19.678 --> 00:22:22.947
Okay. We have only three movements, guys.

00:22:22.948 --> 00:22:25.347
- I want arms around arms. - What?

00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:27.087
Everybody, lie down.

00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:31.518
(Core Training 1: Lying down, arm in arm)

00:22:33.158 --> 00:22:37.897
(It starts with the cool waves.)

00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:39.127
Oh, my gosh.

00:22:39.128 --> 00:22:40.328
It must be cool.

00:22:40.398 --> 00:22:41.468
And kick.

00:22:41.628 --> 00:22:44.568
- Kick. - My gosh.

00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:49.407
(Kicking while tightening the core)

00:22:49.408 --> 00:22:51.537
One, two, three, four, five,

00:22:51.538 --> 00:22:52.747
- six, seven... - The water is coming!

00:22:52.748 --> 00:22:54.977
(While being hit by the waves, )

00:22:54.978 --> 00:22:58.518
(they strengthen their core muscles.)

00:22:59.418 --> 00:23:00.987
(The chaotic kicking is over.)

00:23:00.988 --> 00:23:01.988
All right.

00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:03.758
Synchronized sit-up.

00:23:03.988 --> 00:23:05.517
- Oh, my gosh. - When I say, "Down,"

00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:06.728
you go down.

00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:08.227
- Down. - Together?

00:23:08.228 --> 00:23:09.288
Together?

00:23:09.698 --> 00:23:10.757
Down.

00:23:10.758 --> 00:23:11.858
Up.

00:23:12.598 --> 00:23:13.627
Down.

00:23:13.628 --> 00:23:14.697
(Down)

00:23:14.698 --> 00:23:16.537
- Up. - One.

00:23:16.538 --> 00:23:17.538
Down.

00:23:18.368 --> 00:23:20.667
(Synchronized sit-up, )

00:23:20.668 --> 00:23:23.478
(where no one can slack off)

00:23:24.038 --> 00:23:25.838
- Up. - Four.

00:23:26.478 --> 00:23:34.218
(Strengthning the core muscles all together)

00:23:34.448 --> 00:23:35.548
Up.

00:23:35.988 --> 00:23:39.657
(The sense of unity strengthens as much as their core muscles.)

00:23:39.658 --> 00:23:40.687
Last one. Up.

00:23:40.688 --> 00:23:41.987
(The sense of unity strengthens as much as their core muscles.)

00:23:41.988 --> 00:23:43.527
- Yes! - Okay.

00:23:43.528 --> 00:23:44.597
Oh, my gosh.

00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:47.428
This is like a training session for Special Forces like UDT.

00:23:47.768 --> 00:23:49.397
This is really fun!

00:23:49.398 --> 00:23:51.168
- It's so much fun. - I know.

00:23:51.238 --> 00:23:53.284
When else will I ever get to do something like this?

00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:54.668
High plank.

00:23:55.108 --> 00:23:56.378
Keep your arms straight.

00:23:56.438 --> 00:23:59.138
Raise them.

00:24:02.678 --> 00:24:03.977
(Screaming)

00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:05.248
This is great.

00:24:06.048 --> 00:24:10.288
(They hold the plank position until everyone passes through.)

00:24:10.688 --> 00:24:12.088
Go.

00:24:12.488 --> 00:24:13.987
You have to hurry...

00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:15.434
to make things easier for the other people.

00:24:15.458 --> 00:24:16.528
(Groaning)

00:24:17.658 --> 00:24:19.098
This is hard.

00:24:19.128 --> 00:24:21.627
(Core training and ranger training at the same time)

00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:23.667
- Go. - Get closer.

00:24:23.668 --> 00:24:24.668
Closer.

00:24:25.538 --> 00:24:26.538
(Attacked by the waves)

00:24:26.538 --> 00:24:27.538
You have to keep going.

00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:29.578
You have to keep going.

00:24:30.638 --> 00:24:31.707
(Spitting water)

00:24:31.708 --> 00:24:32.778
Keep going.

00:24:33.778 --> 00:24:34.977
(Ju Hyun also struggles against the waves.)

00:24:34.978 --> 00:24:36.078
You got this!

00:24:36.418 --> 00:24:39.078
We have to win the match!

00:24:40.048 --> 00:24:41.747
- You can do this. - What is this?

00:24:41.748 --> 00:24:43.158
- You can do this. - My gosh.

00:24:43.758 --> 00:24:45.418
You can do this, Park Ju Hyun!

00:24:46.388 --> 00:24:47.758
You can do this, Uie!

00:24:48.188 --> 00:24:49.828
You should get closer.

00:24:50.258 --> 00:24:51.527
You can do this!

00:24:51.528 --> 00:24:53.468
(Splash)

00:24:54.198 --> 00:24:56.068
Let's knock our opponents out!

00:24:56.498 --> 00:24:57.738
- Three. - Three.

00:24:58.068 --> 00:24:59.808
- Two. - Two.

00:24:59.968 --> 00:25:01.238
- One. - Yes.

00:25:01.938 --> 00:25:06.277
(The Pirate Camp is over.)

00:25:06.278 --> 00:25:09.108
This is like Special Forces.

00:25:09.248 --> 00:25:10.377
That was so cool.

00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:11.977
Thank you, guys.

00:25:11.978 --> 00:25:13.648
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:25:14.118 --> 00:25:15.488
Phuket is nice.

00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:16.858
I love Phuket.

00:25:16.918 --> 00:25:19.187
Hey, guys. Well done today.

00:25:19.188 --> 00:25:20.228
We have...

00:25:20.388 --> 00:25:22.027
a surprise!

00:25:22.028 --> 00:25:23.628
(We have medals.)

00:25:25.258 --> 00:25:28.168
Everybody is a winner!

00:25:28.298 --> 00:25:29.837
(Yes, it's a medal!)

00:25:29.838 --> 00:25:31.097
- You're the winner. - Thanks.

00:25:31.098 --> 00:25:32.567
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:25:32.568 --> 00:25:34.267
Thank you.

00:25:34.268 --> 00:25:35.608
I love medals.

00:25:35.738 --> 00:25:37.178
I like medals.

00:25:37.538 --> 00:25:39.178
- Thank you. - Medal!

00:25:39.878 --> 00:25:42.447
(They share the joy...)

00:25:42.448 --> 00:25:46.148
(of finishing the course with their colleagues.)

00:25:46.288 --> 00:25:48.347
So the training is over.

00:25:48.348 --> 00:25:50.987
It was a training session available only in Phuket.

00:25:50.988 --> 00:25:52.957
I was even jealous of the trainees here.

00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:55.627
I could see your desire to exercise during the training.

00:25:55.628 --> 00:25:57.998
In the ring, I fight alone.

00:25:58.028 --> 00:26:00.497
But I could be with other people during the training,

00:26:00.498 --> 00:26:02.068
- which made me really happy. - Okay.

00:26:02.098 --> 00:26:04.037
It felt like such a special training session,

00:26:04.038 --> 00:26:05.468
so I was really excited.

00:26:05.638 --> 00:26:07.318
- Thank you so much. - You got the energy.

00:26:08.038 --> 00:26:09.437
I loved working out...

00:26:09.438 --> 00:26:11.407
early in the morning...

00:26:11.408 --> 00:26:13.847
on my first visit to Phuket.

00:26:13.848 --> 00:26:17.277
When else would I get to work out with such a great coach?

00:26:17.278 --> 00:26:18.348
It was a lot of fun.

00:26:19.218 --> 00:26:20.518
It was really fun.

00:26:20.888 --> 00:26:21.947
- KO! - KO!

00:26:21.948 --> 00:26:23.957
- Iron! - Iron!

00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:25.757
- Girls! - Girls!

00:26:25.758 --> 00:26:26.928
(KO Iron Girls)

00:26:27.888 --> 00:26:30.098
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:26:30.358 --> 00:26:31.797
- Let's go. - Let's go.

00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:33.868
(The intense first training session is over.)

00:26:33.968 --> 00:26:36.097
We haven't had a single meal in Thailand yet.

00:26:36.098 --> 00:26:37.098
That's true.

00:26:37.099 --> 00:26:38.598
This is our first meal in Thailand.

00:26:38.698 --> 00:26:40.167
I want to know...

00:26:40.168 --> 00:26:42.637
- what we are going to eat, Captain. - This place...

00:26:42.638 --> 00:26:44.638
is beloved by exercise enthusiasts.

00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:45.708
- I see. - That's because...

00:26:45.709 --> 00:26:48.008
it offers a lot of dishes that exercise enthusiasts love.

00:26:48.408 --> 00:26:49.977
- Healthy food. - Really?

00:26:49.978 --> 00:26:51.048
Healthy food.

00:26:51.478 --> 00:26:53.647
The restaurant is totally different.

00:26:53.648 --> 00:26:54.988
(Healthy food?)

00:26:55.118 --> 00:26:56.657
You know people who are crazy about workouts.

00:26:56.658 --> 00:26:57.957
They are called...

00:26:57.958 --> 00:26:59.657
- workout enthusiasts. - Yes.

00:26:59.658 --> 00:27:01.387
Workout enthusiasts love this place.

00:27:01.388 --> 00:27:02.457
- This place? - Because...

00:27:02.458 --> 00:27:03.757
Are you sure we're going to eat?

00:27:03.758 --> 00:27:05.257
Of course. We're going to eat.

00:27:05.258 --> 00:27:06.467
We're not going to build muscles, are we?

00:27:06.468 --> 00:27:07.698
Not at all.

00:27:08.068 --> 00:27:09.127
We're here.

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:10.574
(They've arrived at the place beloved by workout enthusiasts.)

00:27:10.598 --> 00:27:11.768
Shall we go?

00:27:13.468 --> 00:27:14.537
(Heading to the restaurant with the atmosphere of Phuket.)

00:27:14.538 --> 00:27:15.538
It looks different already.

00:27:15.539 --> 00:27:17.038
It does feel exotic.

00:27:17.438 --> 00:27:20.047
This street is very famous.

00:27:20.048 --> 00:27:21.107
Really?

00:27:21.108 --> 00:27:23.294
(This street lined with shops is a famous attraction in Phuket?)

00:27:23.318 --> 00:27:25.477
- All the people here... - Yes?

00:27:25.478 --> 00:27:26.847
- are very muscular. - Right.

00:27:26.848 --> 00:27:29.117
Look. There's a topless man.

00:27:29.118 --> 00:27:30.888
People walk around without a shirt on here.

00:27:31.658 --> 00:27:32.688
Why?

00:27:32.888 --> 00:27:33.987
All the places here are like a gym.

00:27:33.988 --> 00:27:35.057
Here and there.

00:27:35.058 --> 00:27:36.627
(What is this unusual street?)

00:27:36.628 --> 00:27:37.697
The name of this street...

00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:39.228
is Soi Ta-iad.

00:27:39.968 --> 00:27:41.997
There are a lot of gyms on this street.

00:27:41.998 --> 00:27:43.097
(It's called the Fitness Street.)

00:27:43.098 --> 00:27:44.597
All the places over there are gyms.

00:27:44.598 --> 00:27:45.997
There are huge gyms.

00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:47.907
There are many different kinds of gyms.

00:27:47.908 --> 00:27:49.267
(There are a variety of gyms here.)

00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:50.638
They are all gyms,

00:27:51.008 --> 00:27:52.877
and they are huge.

00:27:52.878 --> 00:27:54.308
(World-class large-scale gyms)

00:27:54.648 --> 00:27:56.929
A lot of athletes from around the world visit this place,

00:27:57.218 --> 00:27:59.378
so it has become a street for athletes.

00:28:00.448 --> 00:28:02.217
When people come here for vacation,

00:28:02.218 --> 00:28:03.257
they usually stay for a month.

00:28:03.258 --> 00:28:05.017
- Just to work out? - Just to work out.

00:28:05.018 --> 00:28:06.088
That's amazing.

00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:08.888
(Gyms lined up along the street)

00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:11.297
Those who are crazy about sports...

00:28:11.298 --> 00:28:13.628
come here to work out and rest.

00:28:16.598 --> 00:28:18.537
- My gosh. - Gloves.

00:28:18.538 --> 00:28:20.168
Look at the sporting goods.

00:28:20.538 --> 00:28:23.007
This place is for physical treatments.

00:28:23.008 --> 00:28:25.238
(There are also sports injury clinics.)

00:28:25.308 --> 00:28:27.477
This place has everything related to workout.

00:28:27.478 --> 00:28:28.508
That's true.

00:28:29.078 --> 00:28:31.877
I can see why people who love working out com here.

00:28:31.878 --> 00:28:33.638
- This neighborhood is interesting. - Right?

00:28:33.988 --> 00:28:36.588
Do you see the poster on your left?

00:28:37.658 --> 00:28:39.418
There are always Muay Thai matches.

00:28:40.058 --> 00:28:41.157
- Really? - Muay Thai?

00:28:41.158 --> 00:28:42.557
- Are they real matches? - They have...

00:28:42.558 --> 00:28:43.718
Muay Thai matches every week.

00:28:43.758 --> 00:28:45.498
The place in front of you...

00:28:45.698 --> 00:28:46.868
is for conditioning.

00:28:46.998 --> 00:28:49.328
- What is this? - Like the CrossFit you tried.

00:28:49.468 --> 00:28:51.798
This is where you train for fitness races.

00:28:52.268 --> 00:28:55.838
(This is the gym for fitness races, which the Iron Girls tried before.)

00:28:56.008 --> 00:28:57.207
Hi.

00:28:57.208 --> 00:28:58.538
(Maximum inner intimacy)

00:28:58.908 --> 00:29:00.078
Burn!

00:29:00.408 --> 00:29:01.678
Let's burn!

00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:04.817
Even the cafe...

00:29:04.818 --> 00:29:07.318
- sells protein shake here. - Look. Protein shake.

00:29:08.488 --> 00:29:10.617
- Protein ball. - Protein ball.

00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:11.988
(Even the menu feels healthy.)

00:29:12.288 --> 00:29:14.187
The ice cream shops sell protein.

00:29:14.188 --> 00:29:15.188
Really?

00:29:15.189 --> 00:29:16.897
- You're right. Froyo. - Protein.

00:29:16.898 --> 00:29:18.557
(This is their first time seeing protein ice cream.)

00:29:18.558 --> 00:29:20.528
We can have protein for dessert later.

00:29:20.768 --> 00:29:22.067
This is a pharmacy.

00:29:22.068 --> 00:29:23.338
There are a lot of pharmacies.

00:29:23.368 --> 00:29:24.538
Look. There's protein.

00:29:25.198 --> 00:29:27.338
I somehow don't like this neighborhood.

00:29:28.008 --> 00:29:30.077
- There's a fruit shop. - You can get injured.

00:29:30.078 --> 00:29:31.408
A fruit shop.

00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:32.608
It's healthy.

00:29:33.278 --> 00:29:34.577
Protein shake.

00:29:34.578 --> 00:29:35.947
(It's a protein shake store that pretends to be a fruit store.)

00:29:35.948 --> 00:29:38.348
This place is crazy for workouts.

00:29:38.378 --> 00:29:40.748
I think we can call it the protein street.

00:29:41.248 --> 00:29:43.258
Can we try the protein shake?

00:29:43.388 --> 00:29:44.388
We can.

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:45.557
Look here.

00:29:45.558 --> 00:29:47.358
They have all kinds of protein here.

00:29:47.628 --> 00:29:48.857
- Smoothie. - I've never seen...

00:29:48.858 --> 00:29:50.578
that sells so many kinds of protein before.

00:29:50.628 --> 00:29:51.898
Do you want to try one?

00:29:52.128 --> 00:29:54.228
I think you can choose a flavor.

00:29:54.898 --> 00:29:56.268
It says flavors here.

00:29:56.898 --> 00:29:57.997
It sounds delicious.

00:29:57.998 --> 00:29:59.137
(It sounds delicious.)

00:29:59.138 --> 00:30:02.438
Mixed berry milk yogurt honey with protein.

00:30:02.908 --> 00:30:03.937
- This... - How much?

00:30:03.938 --> 00:30:05.038
Isn't this a toy?

00:30:06.378 --> 00:30:08.177
Is it sleeping like this?

00:30:08.178 --> 00:30:09.277
(The cat is napping peacefully.)

00:30:09.278 --> 00:30:11.748
The cat is sleeping in a Muay Thai pose.

00:30:11.878 --> 00:30:13.188
It's a Muay Thai pose.

00:30:13.248 --> 00:30:14.388
It's so cute.

00:30:14.848 --> 00:30:16.217
What kind of cat is that?

00:30:16.218 --> 00:30:18.194
(Even the cat looks extraordinary in the fitness street.)

00:30:18.218 --> 00:30:19.858
He puts ice in it.

00:30:19.988 --> 00:30:22.358
(They get up, curious about Phuket-style protein shakes.)

00:30:23.158 --> 00:30:25.528
(Appetizing fresh fruit)

00:30:25.798 --> 00:30:28.268
(They put in milk and ice.)

00:30:28.598 --> 00:30:29.667
(One scoop of protein instead of syrup)

00:30:29.668 --> 00:30:30.968
He adds the protein.

00:30:36.408 --> 00:30:37.807
(Mixed berry and mango protein shakes are done.)

00:30:37.808 --> 00:30:39.138
- Thank you. - My gosh.

00:30:39.378 --> 00:30:40.408
Try it.

00:30:40.708 --> 00:30:41.977
It looks delicious.

00:30:41.978 --> 00:30:42.978
(Expectant)

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:45.278
(Captain tries a cool sip first.)

00:30:45.348 --> 00:30:46.378
How is it?

00:30:46.418 --> 00:30:47.448
It's nice.

00:30:47.988 --> 00:30:49.017
It's nice. It tastes good.

00:30:49.018 --> 00:30:50.788
(In Ah tries it after Captain.)

00:30:57.528 --> 00:30:58.797
What's with her face?

00:30:58.798 --> 00:31:00.168
It tastes good.

00:31:00.628 --> 00:31:02.728
- My gosh. - It has the taste of protein.

00:31:03.468 --> 00:31:05.568
(It's somewhat strange.)

00:31:05.768 --> 00:31:06.967
It is good,

00:31:06.968 --> 00:31:08.037
but it just tastes like protein.

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:09.308
Isn't that nice?

00:31:09.508 --> 00:31:11.778
- It's healthy and tasty. - Their faces look funny.

00:31:12.408 --> 00:31:14.008
You should be happy about this.

00:31:14.448 --> 00:31:15.907
All right. I'm happy.

00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:17.494
(They force a smile, knowing it's good for their health.)

00:31:17.518 --> 00:31:19.078
It's not bad.

00:31:19.418 --> 00:31:20.748
Enjoy it.

00:31:21.588 --> 00:31:23.557
- Okay. - Where's the restaurant?

00:31:23.558 --> 00:31:24.688
We're almost there.

00:31:25.718 --> 00:31:28.188
Look here. This place looks nice.

00:31:30.028 --> 00:31:31.398
I bet this place is famous.

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.097
All right. This is the restaurant we're going to.

00:31:34.098 --> 00:31:35.767
- What? - Yes.

00:31:35.768 --> 00:31:36.967
It's the best. Let's go.

00:31:36.968 --> 00:31:38.074
- Finally. - We're finally here.

00:31:38.098 --> 00:31:39.098
Look.

00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:40.408
(They are excited to eat.)

00:31:40.838 --> 00:31:41.868
I like it.

00:31:42.308 --> 00:31:43.484
- Finally. - It looks delicious.

00:31:43.508 --> 00:31:44.788
- Where do we sit? - It's clean.

00:31:45.338 --> 00:31:46.608
- It's clean. - Finally.

00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:48.407
- It must be delicious. - Here.

00:31:48.408 --> 00:31:49.648
Sit here.

00:31:50.478 --> 00:31:51.948
- I'm hungry. - Yes.

00:31:52.078 --> 00:31:53.917
- The food we are going to eat... - Okay.

00:31:53.918 --> 00:31:55.647
The main dishes are here.

00:31:55.648 --> 00:31:56.887
The name is...

00:31:56.888 --> 00:31:59.288
muscle meals.

00:31:59.658 --> 00:32:00.658
So...

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:02.658
(Even the name is muscle meals?)

00:32:03.428 --> 00:32:05.527
So, the dishes we're going to eat are...

00:32:05.528 --> 00:32:08.098
- What's special is... - Yes.

00:32:08.498 --> 00:32:09.597
That you can choose what you want.

00:32:09.598 --> 00:32:11.138
On your plate...

00:32:11.598 --> 00:32:13.967
You can choose a sauce and a protein.

00:32:13.968 --> 00:32:15.408
It also says...

00:32:15.608 --> 00:32:17.307
how much carbohydrate it contains.

00:32:17.308 --> 00:32:18.977
So you can choose what you want.

00:32:18.978 --> 00:32:20.247
(They can choose based on its mutritional information.)

00:32:20.248 --> 00:32:21.508
(Carbohydrates, fat, protein)

00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:25.378
(A muscle meal is packed with healthy ingredients.)

00:32:25.718 --> 00:32:26.887
When you try it,

00:32:26.888 --> 00:32:29.088
you will think, "This is healthy and delicious."

00:32:29.188 --> 00:32:30.857
Choose what you want here. And there's more.

00:32:30.858 --> 00:32:31.917
Look.

00:32:31.918 --> 00:32:34.227
- Here, there's pasta. - Pasta.

00:32:34.228 --> 00:32:35.668
- Can we have pasta? - Look at this.

00:32:36.428 --> 00:32:37.958
This is bolognese.

00:32:38.298 --> 00:32:40.928
- It contains 38g of protein. - That's amazing.

00:32:40.998 --> 00:32:43.004
- I want to try it. - I bet it tastes like protein.

00:32:43.028 --> 00:32:44.597
They also have pancakes.

00:32:44.598 --> 00:32:46.044
- You can have pancakes. - I want pancakes.

00:32:46.068 --> 00:32:49.707
- But it's protein pancakes. - But it's protein pancakes.

00:32:49.708 --> 00:32:51.278
(Feeling faint)

00:32:51.308 --> 00:32:52.938
No more protein.

00:32:53.038 --> 00:32:55.647
These pancakes have 42g of protein.

00:32:55.648 --> 00:32:56.718
I'm getting sick of it.

00:32:56.948 --> 00:32:58.917
They've got it all. Shrimps...

00:32:58.918 --> 00:32:59.947
(Captain Kim)

00:32:59.948 --> 00:33:00.948
What is it?

00:33:00.949 --> 00:33:02.647
I was looking forward to eating pad Thai.

00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:03.818
Or green papaya salad.

00:33:04.088 --> 00:33:06.528
- Stir-fried morning glory. - We're going to eat all of that.

00:33:06.658 --> 00:33:09.127
But we worked out a lot this morning.

00:33:09.128 --> 00:33:11.197
We trained excruciatingly hard.

00:33:11.198 --> 00:33:13.127
So we have to eat healthy protein...

00:33:13.128 --> 00:33:14.897
and healthy vegetables first.

00:33:14.898 --> 00:33:16.867
We'll eat the tasty food later.

00:33:16.868 --> 00:33:18.967
- I promise. - You’ll guarantee that we can eat?

00:33:18.968 --> 00:33:20.007
Yes, 100 percent.

00:33:20.008 --> 00:33:21.368
- Okay. - All right.

00:33:21.638 --> 00:33:23.408
Choose what you want to eat.

00:33:23.538 --> 00:33:24.877
We'll share.

00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:26.537
It kind of feels as if...

00:33:26.538 --> 00:33:29.377
we're at a protein theme park.

00:33:29.378 --> 00:33:31.317
Everything here has protein in it.

00:33:31.318 --> 00:33:34.248
It's like "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."

00:33:34.388 --> 00:33:35.717
- This is the Protein Factory. - Right.

00:33:35.718 --> 00:33:37.517
Cicada Kim's Protein Factory.

00:33:37.518 --> 00:33:40.528
- It's all protein. - What a unique neiborhood.

00:33:41.028 --> 00:33:44.057
- I feel like we'll reach our limit. - This is too much protein.

00:33:44.058 --> 00:33:45.957
Even if it's healthy for us...

00:33:45.958 --> 00:33:47.867
The thing is,

00:33:47.868 --> 00:33:49.567
a lot of people think this is plenty of protein,

00:33:49.568 --> 00:33:51.167
but actually, it's not enough...

00:33:51.168 --> 00:33:52.337
- for athletes. - So how much is enough?

00:33:52.338 --> 00:33:53.407
On average,

00:33:53.408 --> 00:33:58.437
people should consume about 0.8g of protein per kilogram of body weight.

00:33:58.438 --> 00:33:59.677
And athletes...

00:33:59.678 --> 00:34:02.277
should consume 1.2g to 2g of protein per kilogram of body weight.

00:34:02.278 --> 00:34:03.517
So if you're 50kg,

00:34:03.518 --> 00:34:05.677
you have to consume 100g of protein.

00:34:05.678 --> 00:34:08.017
Let's say you have 200g of chicken breast.

00:34:08.018 --> 00:34:09.387
People tend to think there's 200g of protein,

00:34:09.388 --> 00:34:12.517
but actually there's only 30g to 40g of protein.

00:34:12.518 --> 00:34:13.664
(The protein content is lower than they expected.)

00:34:13.688 --> 00:34:16.287
And our bodies don’t absorb all the protein we eat.

00:34:16.288 --> 00:34:17.927
- Right. - So we have to eat a lot more.

00:34:17.928 --> 00:34:19.498
I can do that.

00:34:19.858 --> 00:34:22.867
Captain, why do we have to eat protein?

00:34:22.868 --> 00:34:23.868
I don't know why.

00:34:24.338 --> 00:34:27.467
As we age, protein is the most important nutrient in our bodies.

00:34:27.468 --> 00:34:30.907
When we lose muscle, we get injured easily.

00:34:30.908 --> 00:34:31.937
It's not good for our health either.

00:34:31.938 --> 00:34:34.747
So increasing protein intake is recommended for the elderly.

00:34:34.748 --> 00:34:37.818
I should bring my mom and dad here.

00:34:38.648 --> 00:34:41.847
- You think they'll like it? - I'll bring my mom, dad,

00:34:41.848 --> 00:34:43.457
grandmother, and grandfather to Protein Street.

00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:44.698
I don't think they'll enjoy it.

00:34:45.758 --> 00:34:49.028
We're ten days away from the match.

00:34:49.188 --> 00:34:51.698
Are you all eating healthy?

00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:54.268
In Ah keeps texting me.

00:34:54.428 --> 00:34:56.867
She keeps asking me if her diet is okay.

00:34:56.868 --> 00:34:58.574
- She's very anxious about it. - I get it, though.

00:34:58.598 --> 00:35:01.107
I didn't realize at first,

00:35:01.108 --> 00:35:02.407
but the joy and sorrow felt by...

00:35:02.408 --> 00:35:05.438
those of us who have to lose weight and those who don't...

00:35:05.608 --> 00:35:06.877
is really different.

00:35:06.878 --> 00:35:10.147
I told you that people get stressed over just a couple of kilograms.

00:35:10.148 --> 00:35:12.478
- I'm like that right now. - Losing 2kg is stressful.

00:35:12.678 --> 00:35:15.517
And this is my secret tip.

00:35:15.518 --> 00:35:17.478
(Captain Kim has a secret tip for losing weight?)

00:35:17.658 --> 00:35:19.587
You know how you don't have an appetite when you wake up?

00:35:19.588 --> 00:35:21.487
And how you don't have an appetite when your workout is over?

00:35:21.488 --> 00:35:23.697
- That's when you have to eat. - But I can't.

00:35:23.698 --> 00:35:25.197
When you eat your meals then,

00:35:25.198 --> 00:35:27.827
you can force yourself to eat healthy.

00:35:27.828 --> 00:35:29.327
It's easier to control your appetite.

00:35:29.328 --> 00:35:30.768
But when you eat when you're hungry,

00:35:31.298 --> 00:35:32.897
not even athletes can control their appetites.

00:35:32.898 --> 00:35:35.967
You really sound like an expert.

00:35:35.968 --> 00:35:37.078
So impressive.

00:35:37.538 --> 00:35:38.708
I'm a true athlete.

00:35:39.538 --> 00:35:40.577
Okay.

00:35:40.578 --> 00:35:42.324
(Their long-awaited first meal in Phuket is finally here.)

00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:44.348
- This looks good. - Those are tofu.

00:35:44.548 --> 00:35:46.117
- Thank you. - This looks so good.

00:35:46.118 --> 00:35:47.348
This looks so good.

00:35:47.848 --> 00:35:49.688
This looks so appetizing. It's an actual meal.

00:35:49.718 --> 00:35:50.887
This looks so nice.

00:35:50.888 --> 00:35:52.094
(A special meal for the Iron Girls who did hard training)

00:35:52.118 --> 00:35:53.857
I ordered chicken,

00:35:53.858 --> 00:35:55.957
sweet potatoes, and steamed vegetables.

00:35:55.958 --> 00:35:59.558
I ordered beef, potatoes, and steamed vegetables.

00:35:59.798 --> 00:36:03.128
I ordered bolognese, brown rice, and steamed vegetables.

00:36:03.328 --> 00:36:07.638
I ordered beef bolognese, brown rice, and steamed vegetables.

00:36:07.938 --> 00:36:09.637
If you worked out hard, go ahead and eat.

00:36:09.638 --> 00:36:11.678
(With bolognese pasta that contains 38g of protein)

00:36:12.108 --> 00:36:13.807
- Gosh. - Enjoy your food.

00:36:13.808 --> 00:36:15.208
(How does the food taste?)

00:36:15.578 --> 00:36:16.847
- This looks good. - I love this.

00:36:16.848 --> 00:36:18.318
I'm so happy.

00:36:18.948 --> 00:36:21.617
I'm so curious about the protein spaghetti.

00:36:21.618 --> 00:36:23.048
Right. This one.

00:36:23.658 --> 00:36:26.388
(Taking a huge bite)

00:36:27.028 --> 00:36:28.388
(Delicious)

00:36:28.888 --> 00:36:30.958
(In Ah takes a bite too.)

00:36:33.128 --> 00:36:34.467
(She also tries the sauce.)

00:36:34.468 --> 00:36:35.668
Try this.

00:36:39.138 --> 00:36:42.968
(The captain slurps on his food.)

00:36:44.438 --> 00:36:46.438
(Delicious)

00:36:47.148 --> 00:36:50.278
(Mouth open wide)

00:36:50.478 --> 00:36:51.478
This is good.

00:36:53.918 --> 00:36:55.847
- Have some more. - I want to try some.

00:36:55.848 --> 00:36:57.187
This is so good.

00:36:57.188 --> 00:36:59.134
(She didn't expect the healthy food to have such a rich flavor.)

00:36:59.158 --> 00:37:00.428
- It's good. - It is.

00:37:01.128 --> 00:37:03.527
Seriously, this is so good.

00:37:03.528 --> 00:37:04.934
(Now, let's try the muscle-building food.)

00:37:04.958 --> 00:37:07.328
(They each try the dish they chose.)

00:37:07.728 --> 00:37:08.768
(Delicious)

00:37:09.098 --> 00:37:10.128
Is it good?

00:37:10.368 --> 00:37:11.568
Gosh, this is nice.

00:37:14.038 --> 00:37:16.708
(The food tastes so good that In Ah can't help but move her body.)

00:37:20.778 --> 00:37:21.778
(Delicious)

00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:25.317
(She dips the juicy shrimp in the sauce.)

00:37:25.318 --> 00:37:27.948
- I want to learn how to make this. - The camp was...

00:37:30.258 --> 00:37:32.018
(Eyes open wide)

00:37:32.718 --> 00:37:34.357
Even the carrot tastes good.

00:37:34.358 --> 00:37:36.238
I'm telling you. It can be tasty just the same.

00:37:36.358 --> 00:37:38.027
(They wordlessly exclaim in awe.)

00:37:38.028 --> 00:37:39.058
(Delicious)

00:37:40.128 --> 00:37:43.668
It's been a while since we all ate together, right?

00:37:44.298 --> 00:37:45.898
- Yes. - It's been a while.

00:37:46.268 --> 00:37:48.108
But it's nice to see that you still eat a lot.

00:37:48.138 --> 00:37:50.067
It feels like I'm eating with...

00:37:50.068 --> 00:37:51.538
my fellow professional athletes.

00:37:52.078 --> 00:37:53.307
I haven't eaten enough.

00:37:53.308 --> 00:37:55.977
You have to eat good to use your strength.

00:37:55.978 --> 00:37:58.218
If you don't, your performance won't be good.

00:37:58.618 --> 00:37:59.878
This is so good.

00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:02.417
- Thank you. - Are you done with this?

00:38:02.418 --> 00:38:03.657
- What? - You guys look like you starved.

00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:04.964
(They order more food right away.)

00:38:04.988 --> 00:38:05.988
(Menu added, plus 3)

00:38:06.388 --> 00:38:07.487
More food?

00:38:07.488 --> 00:38:08.657
- For you. - There's more.

00:38:08.658 --> 00:38:11.798
At this point, you're eating more than the athletes on my team.

00:38:12.058 --> 00:38:13.158
Seriously.

00:38:13.328 --> 00:38:15.467
When I get food with the younger athletes,

00:38:15.468 --> 00:38:17.514
I can usually get a grasp on how much food they order.

00:38:17.538 --> 00:38:19.697
You can't tell anyone that we eat this much.

00:38:19.698 --> 00:38:21.367
I think I misspoke earlier.

00:38:21.368 --> 00:38:23.738
If you eat too much protein,

00:38:24.138 --> 00:38:26.537
it can be stored as fat. So mind the amount too.

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:29.707
Please have an idea of how much protein you should be eating.

00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:30.918
This tastes even better.

00:38:31.548 --> 00:38:33.277
I could probably eat healthy my whole life.

00:38:33.278 --> 00:38:34.947
Gosh, this is so good.

00:38:34.948 --> 00:38:36.064
I can't believe how good this is.

00:38:36.088 --> 00:38:37.858
You were all worried earlier...

00:38:38.118 --> 00:38:40.427
that healthy food wouldn't taste good. So how was it?

00:38:40.428 --> 00:38:41.527
- It was so tasty. - It was so tasty.

00:38:41.528 --> 00:38:42.787
- Right? - Yes.

00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:46.058
We can stick to healthy food forever if it tastes like this.

00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:48.427
We still have to eat pu pad pong karee.

00:38:48.428 --> 00:38:49.428
(Is he trying to make us eat healthy food the whole trip?)

00:38:49.429 --> 00:38:50.997
Please let us have pad Thai at least once.

00:38:50.998 --> 00:38:52.598
- Please. - You mean the local pad Thai?

00:38:53.168 --> 00:38:55.067
Is it okay if we add protein to the curry?

00:38:55.068 --> 00:38:56.068
Gosh.

00:38:56.608 --> 00:38:58.177
(Loathing the idea)

00:38:58.178 --> 00:38:59.477
Curry with protein powder.

00:38:59.478 --> 00:39:01.807
I feel like that could actually be a thing.

00:39:01.808 --> 00:39:04.177
Yes, protein. And pad Thai made with protein noodles.

00:39:04.178 --> 00:39:05.378
(No more protein.)

00:39:05.748 --> 00:39:08.518
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:12.687
Let’s clean up and go sparring.

00:39:12.688 --> 00:39:14.404
(Iron Boot Camp in Phuket. Where will they be training next?)

00:39:14.428 --> 00:39:17.328
(Located on the fitness street that is lined with gyms)

00:39:18.128 --> 00:39:21.868
(A local boxing gym in Phuket)

00:39:22.968 --> 00:39:26.038
(This is where the Iron Girls will be sparring today.)

00:39:26.468 --> 00:39:28.468
I guess we can't get away from here.

00:39:28.668 --> 00:39:29.738
Gosh.

00:39:29.908 --> 00:39:30.988
Did you get some good rest?

00:39:31.378 --> 00:39:32.577
(A familiar figure from behind)

00:39:32.578 --> 00:39:34.678
- Hello. - Coach!

00:39:35.148 --> 00:39:37.377
- Coach, we missed you. - Right.

00:39:37.378 --> 00:39:38.447
(Meeting Coach Kim in Phuket feels even more special.)

00:39:38.448 --> 00:39:41.017
Who are we sparring with?

00:39:41.018 --> 00:39:44.018
You will be sparring with foreign boxers...

00:39:44.088 --> 00:39:46.017
who are training in Phuket.

00:39:46.018 --> 00:39:49.588
(Foreign boxers in Phuket)

00:39:50.558 --> 00:39:52.498
(Only 10 days left until their 1st competition)

00:39:54.198 --> 00:39:56.627
(Their first full sparring partners...)

00:39:56.628 --> 00:39:59.338
(were community sports competition veterans.)

00:39:59.968 --> 00:40:02.037
(Their second full sparring partners...)

00:40:02.038 --> 00:40:05.278
(were boxers that each had less than 1 year of experience.)

00:40:06.038 --> 00:40:08.648
(And today, they'll be doing their third full sparring session.)

00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:13.378
(This time, it's with foreign boxers.)

00:40:14.088 --> 00:40:17.258
(This is the final test, with no room to back down.)

00:40:17.958 --> 00:40:21.028
(Will they be able to hold their own against the foreign boxers?)

00:40:21.288 --> 00:40:23.287
They’re matched to our weight class, right?

00:40:23.288 --> 00:40:25.127
- Yes, like you said, - Yes.

00:40:25.128 --> 00:40:28.298
They're in your weight class, so you don't have to worry too much.

00:40:28.398 --> 00:40:31.367
The main purpose of an overseas training camp...

00:40:31.368 --> 00:40:33.867
- Yes? - is to spar with foreign fighters.

00:40:33.868 --> 00:40:35.307
- That's right. - Let's go inside to meet them.

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:36.608
- Let's go! - Let's go.

00:40:36.708 --> 00:40:38.078
Take a look at this boxing gym.

00:40:38.278 --> 00:40:39.337
- It's amazing. - We've got to try it out.

00:40:39.338 --> 00:40:40.407
(They go inside the gym where they'll be sparring.)

00:40:40.408 --> 00:40:41.508
- Hello. - I'm nervous.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.269
- Gosh. I love this. - Look at all these pictures.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.239
How many people have been here?

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.669
- The color is so nice and vibrant. - Gosh.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:50.980
How many boxing rings are there?

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:52.870
- They have many rings here. - Come on.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.849
(The huge boxing gym is equipped with 3 boxing rings.)

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.880
This is a gym with a long tradition.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.250
From boxing and UFC to MMA,

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.289
many famous fighters have been here.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.919
So many people are obsessed...

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.429
- with boxing. - Yes.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.160
The looks on your faces since we arrived at the gym...

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.399
Right. Don't be discouraged.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.999
- Straighten your shoulders. - This feels different.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.329
- It feels different. - Don't be intimidated.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.299
This is our first time sparring with...

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.870
- foreign boxers. - Yes.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:20.069
- Right. - Will we be all right?

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:21.909
Won't they be more muscular than we are?

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.209
I've always fought against foreign fighters,

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.679
and I think the experience...

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.309
- is truly necessary. - Why?

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.449
Their way of applying force is definitely different.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.449
And the way they approach sparring is different too.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.679
Foreign fighters think of sparring as a match.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.119
- That's right. - Yes. So if someone wants to spar,

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.720
it’s like saying they want a real match.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.829
It's because they think that sparring like it’s a real match...

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.059
helps both participants improve.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.329
- I see. - Really?

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.130
That's why you must remain composed.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.869
Let's not let our eyes give us away.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.829
- Right. - Do we have some eyeliner?

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.069
Ju Hyun said yesterday...

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.269
that she will put eyeliner on for the match.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.110
- We will draw it until here. - To look scary?

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.240
Yes, to look scary.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.170
- So that our glare scares them. - Yes.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.339
Let's go.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.440
Today,

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.649
we won't hear about...

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:03.380
their experience or sport,

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:04.850
but just go on with the sparring...

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:06.219
and then listen to them.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.220
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.520
Then let's bring in our opponents.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.759
Please come out.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.960
(Who will their opponents be?)

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.790
Gosh. Here they come.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.229
You can feel their aura, right?

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:22.630
(The opponents show up.)

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.739
Turn back around.

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.740
(Turn back around.)

00:42:25.741 --> 00:42:26.869
- No. - It seems like they are...

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:28.870
- in a different weight class. - Fix your mindset.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:30.186
They're in a different weight class.

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:31.539
You never know until they get here.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.379
They seem to get bigger as they're getting closer.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.860
(They approach with an unusual aura.)

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:38.949
(Nice to meet you.)

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.120
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:43.919
Nice to meet you.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.520
(He greets the other coach.)

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.759
(Dmitri, assistant boxing coach, Stan, head boxing coach)

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.960
(No response)

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.329
Coaches,

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.200
are you feeling uncomfortable?

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.399
Foreign teams are always like that.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.400
- Amazing. - Yes.

00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:59.539
Anyway, let's just hear their names...

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.269
- and get right to sparring. - Yes, sir.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.240
Okay. Please introduce yourselves.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.479
Hello, my name is Marbie, and I'm from Ireland.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.210
- Ireland. - Ireland.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.579
And my name is Madeline.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.480
- I'm from Australia. - Australia.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.579
My name is Emma, and I'm from the UK.

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.090
- Emma. - UK.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.860
Hello, my name is Saengchan, and I'm from Thailand.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.690
Thailand. Saengchan.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.959
Ireland, Australia,

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.189
- and the UK. - The UK.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.730
- Thailand. - Thailand.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.830
What's going on?

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.969
One thing I'm curious to know...

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:29.899
is whether you live here,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.040
or if you are here on holiday for the match.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.270
I came here for holiday. But now, I'm living here.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:37.639
What? You're living here?

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.680
(She lives here?)

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.350
I've been in Thailand for 15 months now.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.180
Why is she living here?

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:45.649
I came for holiday, and then I just...

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:46.920
loved it, so I stayed.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.789
So I came for holiday. Now, I live here.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.060
And I'm here for training.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.389
They all came here for their holiday.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.859
(They all fell in love with training in Phuket and stayed.)

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.466
- They are all living here. - Gosh. They're all...

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:57.860
I should live here as well.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:59.760
When you have a match,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.899
you get to know your opponent...

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.169
- when you get there. - Yes.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.099
At community sports boxing competitions.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.169
So today,

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.269
we will do a random draw.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.969
(That's why they will do a random draw today.)

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.709
- To make it fair? - Even the order...

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.079
will be done by draw.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.779
That's how we will choose the order for the sparring.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.279
(They will do a random draw for the order as well.)

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.449
This is like an actual match.

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:18.949
They all seem good, so I don't know.

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.049
We just have to go with it.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.250
(The foreign boxer draws the ball first.)

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:23.990
Yes, they drew them.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.889
Great.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.860
(They finished drawing the ball.)

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.160
(They start to get nervous.)

00:44:29.161 --> 00:44:30.860
- Let's go. - Our turn for colors.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:32.330
First, Ju Hyun.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:33.730
Blue.

00:44:33.731 --> 00:44:34.929
(Who will be Ju Hyun's opponent?)

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.840
Blue. Okay. You may greet each other.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:38.900
The face-off.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.039
- Face-off. - Face.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.239
(They exchange intense eye contact.)

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240
Okay.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:47.809
Great.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.009
(Emma versus Ju Hyun)

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.079
Next.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.650
(Saengchan versus Sae Rok)

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.289
Okay. Good.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.690
(Madeline versus In Ah)

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:01.830
(Marbie versus Uie)

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.129
(Today's sparring order)

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.260
Great, then...

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.029
we won't delay it.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:09.870
- Get ready for the sparring. - Yes, sir.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:10.970
Please get ready.

00:45:10.971 --> 00:45:13.170
(The third full sparring)

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.070
(Warming up before the sparring)

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:24.920
(The opponents lightly warm up.)

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.290
Even the competition is nearing. I'm so nervous.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:29.950
Who is our biggest problem?

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.160
Can you tell?

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.060
I really can't tell.

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:35.259
Are you serious? I'm just...

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.589
- so scared. - Don't be scared.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.359
We were always in air-conditioned rooms,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.859
- and doing this outdoors... - Yes.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.330
That consumes a lot of energy.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.069
The weather is hot, so...

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.669
Is it different for each nationality?

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.746
- They're different. - Do they have different styles?

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.040
It doesn't matter what happens.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.610
I will do my best up there.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.309
(10 days left.)

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:58.980
(It's the last sparring before the competition.)

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.349
(How much have the Iron Girls grown?)

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:05.159
Let'ss begin the first sparring.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.420
Emma and Ju Hyun.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:09.929
- Please enter. - Okay. Let's go.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:11.229
Let's go, girl.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:12.260
Let's go.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:15.430
(Completely relaxed)

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:17.769
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun calmly enters the ring.)

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:18.869
Let's go, Ju Hyun.

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:19.916
(Meanwhile, Ju Hyun calmly enters the ring.)

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.469
Why am I so nervous?

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:22.509
- I'm nervous as well. - Really?

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:24.286
- We're all nervous. - If you're not nervous...

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.409
If you're not nervous,

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.110
it means you don't care about the results.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.410
She cares, but she doesn't get nervous.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.279
- I'm nervous now. - What?

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.280
- No way. - No way.

00:46:32.281 --> 00:46:33.419
You're nervous?

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:34.420
(Due to the sparring with a foreign boxer, )

00:46:34.421 --> 00:46:37.550
(Ju Hyun seems to be very tense.)

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.520
(The opponent laughs.)

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.890
And did you spar before with the helmet?

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:44.430
Never.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.360
Congratulations.

00:46:46.361 --> 00:46:48.570
(She had been sparring without wearing the headgear?)

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.300
- Go and watch what she does. - Okay.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.400
Look how she punches. Look first.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.939
Don't rush. Never rush.

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.770
- Just relax and have fun. - Yes.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:58.979
- And then fight afterwards? - Yes.

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.350
- And try to close your guard. - Okay.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.320
She's so optimistic.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.950
What if she hits hard while smiling like that?

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:09.949
I'm nervous.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:11.559
(Ju Hyun finishes preparing with a nervous heart.)

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.620
I can feel it.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:14.219
Fighters, to the front.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.790
(Fighters, to the center.)

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.660
Let's go. Have fun.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.260
Play fair.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:22.169
No attacking the back.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.270
Play fair.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.739
The sparring will consist of 2 rounds of 2 minutes,

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.300
with 40 seconds of rest.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.609
- Okay. Don't rush. - Okay.

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:30.640
Okay.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.439
Box!

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.880
(Round 1 begins.)

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:43.920
(Ju Hyun keeps her distance.)

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.620
(Ju Hyun makes a sudden attack on the body.)

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.500
(And connects it to a body shot)

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.630
(Valid strike)

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.880
(After carefully measuring the time to attack...)

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:10.680
(She makes a valid strike with a jab, )

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:12.450
(and even dodges.)

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.589
That's it. Good.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:17.590
(She calmly observes the timing while leading the opponent.)

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:18.590
Good. Stay calm.

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.440
You can tell her strategy, right?

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:22.270
Thirty minutes have passed.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.530

Lean your hands more.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.989
Okay. Stand with your hands up.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:53.589
That's it.

- You did well. - Go in.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.540
Don't stay so long in close distance.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:12.310

Gosh. She did well.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:37.900
Ju Hyun did so well.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.129
Oh, my gosh. I'm so nervous.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:41.299
Yes, it's good.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.906

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.609
My cardio is ruined right now.

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:50.970
I'm not worried. It's one more round, and that's it.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.539
More lead hand control.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.009

More lead hand control. She will be confused.

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:00.649
Yes? And don't lean so forward.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.489
- Okay. - Stay here and use some feint.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:04.249
What you did really well was when you lightly tapped...

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:05.619
and then gave a strong blow.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.360
You threw three blows.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.860
You need to do what you do well to impact the opponent.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.799
Like what you just did. Light punches...

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.259
- and then a strong... - Can I have some water?

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.300
Two or three strong ones.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.929

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:34.590

(Ju Hyun hits and withdraws first.)

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.519

(Another hit and withdraw)

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.700
Ju Hyun is much better in the second round.

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:49.830
That's it.

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.500
Yes. That's what I was talking about.

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.669
(Watch the opponent move calmly.)

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:57.809
When she punches toward the body, her top is empty.

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.310
Yes. Nice.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:00.540
Yes.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.649
(The opponent pushes her to the corner.)

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:04.780

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.780
(Punch)

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.620

(Exploring each other carefully)

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:25.299
- More right. - She's getting closer again.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.640
Guard up. Yes.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.040
Yes. You got it.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.510

(one-two)

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:36.479
- Yes. You got it. - Beautiful.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.280
- It's okay. You're better. - And to the left. Go out there.

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.319
Go left and go right.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.690
- Beautiful. - Do it at the end.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.960
- Go right means the face. - Go right and up.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.919
- Again. Come on. - That's right.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.329
Nice dodging. And you hit her first.

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.330
Yes.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:51.760
It's been a minute.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:55.399
(However, Ju Hyun doesn't fall back and fights to the end.)

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.830
Nice. Ju Hyun, you're determined.

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.000
Ju Hyun, you're determined.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.509
Go to the middle of the ring.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:02.939
No gap. Go.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.310
- Yes. - Good job.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.579
- Look how she withdraws. - It's better when you think.

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.180

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:09.910

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:11.779

It's better when you think. Withdraw.

Last 30 seconds.

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.759

(Ju Hyun induces an attack, remaining calm)

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.640
Fight back. Yes. Good job.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.079
(Sweeping and striking accurately)

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.710
(Guarding as well)

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.649

(Round 2 ends.)

00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:59.730
Good job.

00:53:59.731 --> 00:54:00.799
(Ju Hyun's fierce sparring is over.)

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.099
Good job. Bow.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.069
- It's all good. Thank you. - Well done.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:05.569
- That was good. - You were so good.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.670
- That was great. - Was Park Ju born to box?

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:09.310
Good job.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:11.939
- You were good. - It hurt so much though.

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.340
Yes, but you were calm and good.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.079
- You have fun? - Yes.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.279
(Sparring was brutally fun.)

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.449
Both fighters did a wonderful job.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:22.950
Please give it up for them.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:27.159
- Gosh. Ju Hyun sometimes goes mad. - Yes, she does.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.530
- Her opponent also went mad. - Yes.

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.859
It was madness versus madness.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.829
- That's right. - It was very dynamic.

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:35.130
To be honest, I was surprised.

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:37.769
First of all, she's very strong.

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:39.440
And she was smiling as she hit me.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:41.470
So I was scared.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.540
(After Ju Hyun's strikes 3 times in a row...)

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.280
(Smiling)

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:49.010
(What? You're scaring me.)

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.809
So I kept telling myself,

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.119
"No. It's okay."

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.180
- I tried to remain calm. - Okay.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.149
I tried so hard to keep calm.

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.819
Emma, you smiled in the middle.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.019
Why were you smiling?

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.390
I'm happy.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:05.160
- That's so cool. - Why happy?

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.159
- Unbelievable. - Look where I am.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.729
I'm in a ring with an amazing opponent.

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:11.370
So how can I not?

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:14.809
I respect.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:16.040
I was surprised too.

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:17.710
And I respect. So...

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.540
- Yes. - For real.

00:55:19.541 --> 00:55:22.350
Anybody can learn how to box. Anybody.

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.979
But not everybody has a spark.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.420
And you have.

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:28.050
(Thank you.)

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.020
(Thank you.)

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:34.220
(The mad boxers shared their passion physically.)

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.289
- That's the charm of boxing. - Right.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:38.699
- When you fight, - It's hot in here.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.429
You hit each other and make each other bleed.

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.246
But after the match, you respect each other...

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:43.469
and become friends. That's the charm of boxing.

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.569
That's right.

00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:46.570
How long have learned to box?

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.270
(The opponent's experience finally unveils.)

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:51.339
Western boxing for two months.

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.580
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my gosh.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:55.150
- Two months? - Yes.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.749
- She's the same. - But she's so good.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:58.550
Did you learn anything before that?

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:00.549
Kickboxing for a bit. Yes.

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.089
- Kickboxing for how long? - Five years.

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:04.649
Five years? I see.

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:06.489
(Emma, UK, 43, psychotherapist)

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:08.590
(5 years of kickboxing)

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:10.889
That jab wasn't from two months. It hurt.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:11.959
- Right. - And it still does.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.099
You have a killer cross.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.530
(Don't act like you're weak.)

00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:18.400
- Oh, a killer cross. - That was very good.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.340
And don't put your hands down.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.239
Because after every punch, you put your hands down.

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.769
- Keep it here. - Right.

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:25.879
Keep them up.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.080
- Right. - Good.

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:29.679
(Ju Hyun's third sparring results:)

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.879
(Strengths: Figures out the opponent's attack timing...)

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.390
(and hits and withdraws quickly)

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:45.499
(Induces the opponent to attack in order to counterattack)

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.030
(Induces the opponent to attack in order to counterattack)

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:53.939
(Points to improve: Lowers the guard after every punch)

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:58.280
(Points to improve: Lowers the guard after every punch)

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.610
- Playing against her was painful. - Well done.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:05.479
- It looked painful. - I even thought...

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.379
- I'd get TKO. - Really?

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.496
- But you endured it pretty well. - It hurt that much.

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.449
- So good. - How was it really?

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:12.766
- No, it was good. - How was it? It was okay?

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:15.730
I couldn't. She was fast. I couldn't get my distance.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.860
That's all right.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:18.929
- She clocked me in the nose too. - Did she?

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:19.960
She did.

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:28.310
(Every time she punched, she hit her nose.)

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:32.679
- You're bleeding a little bit. - Am I?

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.779
That's the cross.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:34.910
The cross.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.849
Prepare for the second sparring.

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:39.880
Uie versus Marbie.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:43.189
(Uie looks frozen as she enters the ring.)

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:44.920
Uie, just keep calm.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:47.460
Let's go.

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:50.930
(On the other hand, the opponent has the composure to hum.)

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.160
(Glancing)

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.730
Like the last time, once it's over,

00:57:57.100 --> 00:57:59.700
it's not a big deal, you know?

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:01.499
There, lead, lead, lead.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.170
You sometimes go to the body.

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:05.740
- Look to the head. Go to the body. - She's taller.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.680
She'll work with her jab.

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:08.949
You go to the body.

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:10.050
Two or three times?

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.120
After that, you feint to the body and go up.

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.220
Okay?

00:58:13.221 --> 00:58:14.550
(Ready)

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:19.120
(Uie is also getting ready.)

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.129
(She's nervous enough to retch.)

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:27.059
We'll begin the second sparring. Please come to the center.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.860
(The fighters for the second sparring enter.)

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:31.400
No leg attack, okay?

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.900
Touch your gloves.

00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:35.170
Fair play.

00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:36.310
Corners.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.409
Take a deep breath.

00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:39.879
(Taking a deep breath)

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.910
- Good. - Okay.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:44.679
Box.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.950
(Round 1 begins.)

00:58:49.585 --> 00:58:52.355
- Hands up. - Hands up.

00:58:52.755 --> 00:58:54.354
(The opponent attacks fiercely.)

00:58:54.355 --> 00:58:56.024
She just threw a strong punch.

00:58:56.025 --> 00:58:57.525
But it was blocked by Uie's jab.

00:58:58.835 --> 00:59:01.195
(The opponent's valid strike became weak due to Uie's jab.)

00:59:02.565 --> 00:59:05.474
(She keeps her distance.)

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:06.915
- She didn't hit you, did she? - No.

00:59:07.535 --> 00:59:08.874
(Uie makes a valid strike just with a jab alone.)

00:59:08.875 --> 00:59:11.355
Because there's a gap in reach, she's going to try to come in.

00:59:11.575 --> 00:59:12.945
(Blocking)

00:59:14.045 --> 00:59:16.015
(Connecting to a straight)

00:59:16.945 --> 00:59:18.815
(Punching strong enough to turn her head)

00:59:19.015 --> 00:59:20.385
(The opponent's body attack)

00:59:20.615 --> 00:59:22.385
(Uie counters with a jab.)

00:59:23.125 --> 00:59:24.824
(However, the opponent hits a two...)

00:59:24.825 --> 00:59:26.595
(in return for Uie's jab.)

00:59:27.095 --> 00:59:29.925
(The opponent breaks through Uie's reach.)

00:59:30.025 --> 00:59:31.125
Oh, she's strong.

00:59:31.635 --> 00:59:33.765
She's going to struggle.

00:59:33.895 --> 00:59:35.835
- Oh, gosh. - She's good with the...

00:59:36.835 --> 00:59:38.134
- She's got good footwork. - Yes.

00:59:38.135 --> 00:59:40.334
Jab for the body right now.

00:59:40.335 --> 00:59:41.335
Thirty seconds have passed.

00:59:41.336 --> 00:59:42.775
Yes.

00:59:43.005 --> 00:59:44.075
- Good. - Beautiful.

00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:46.275
(Dodging)

00:59:47.045 --> 00:59:48.585
(Valid strike, Valid strike 2)

00:59:50.045 --> 00:59:51.415
(Finishing up with a straight)

00:59:51.885 --> 00:59:53.114
Hands up.

00:59:53.115 --> 00:59:54.815
Same combination with the left hand.

00:59:55.055 --> 00:59:56.255
- Head. - Guard up.

00:59:56.355 --> 00:59:57.885
- Punch. - That's right.

00:59:58.755 --> 01:00:00.024
(Uie's jab)

01:00:00.025 --> 01:00:01.295
(The opponent's right hook)

01:00:01.725 --> 01:00:03.895
(Followed by the left hook)

01:00:03.995 --> 01:00:05.095
Beautiful.

01:00:05.195 --> 01:00:07.264
- Her left hook is crazy. - Why are you not doing anything?

01:00:07.265 --> 01:00:09.205
She's good.

01:00:09.865 --> 01:00:11.264
- A minute passed. - Don't go straight.

01:00:11.265 --> 01:00:13.704
Why are you not doing anything after stretching your arm?

01:00:13.705 --> 01:00:15.104
You have to retrieve it.

01:00:15.105 --> 01:00:16.274
Yes, do your footwork.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:17.921
(Uie continues attacking with her footwork.)

01:00:17.945 --> 01:00:19.044
(However, )

01:00:19.045 --> 01:00:20.515
(the opponent dodges easily.)

01:00:22.615 --> 01:00:23.695
Use it when she gets close.

01:00:24.285 --> 01:00:25.485
(Turning)

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:27.715
(Attacking again)

01:00:28.685 --> 01:00:29.725
Don't let her.

01:00:30.155 --> 01:00:33.255
(Strong straight that breaks through Uie's reach)

01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:36.594
(Followed by the body attack)

01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:40.395
She's reading your timing.

01:00:42.535 --> 01:00:43.535
(The opponent attacks at accurate timing.)

01:00:43.536 --> 01:00:45.805
Withdraw. Quick.

01:00:46.835 --> 01:00:49.545
(A very strong straight)

01:00:50.305 --> 01:00:53.175
(An immediate series of attacks)

01:00:56.985 --> 01:00:58.985
I need you to put more weight on your right leg.

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:01.055
You have to get close and guard.

01:01:01.455 --> 01:01:02.585
Yes.

01:01:04.185 --> 01:01:06.895
(A strong body flurry)

01:01:08.395 --> 01:01:10.324
Your opponent knows that you'll jab.

01:01:10.325 --> 01:01:11.964
So deceive her.

01:01:11.965 --> 01:01:13.464
Jab as you deceive her.

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:14.494
Then try one-two.

01:01:14.495 --> 01:01:15.665
Try one-two.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.104
Again.

01:01:17.105 --> 01:01:18.135
Okay.

01:01:19.005 --> 01:01:21.605
(Looking for the timing while doing the footwork)

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.245
(Cross-counter)

01:01:25.775 --> 01:01:28.115
(Cross-counter again)

01:01:28.585 --> 01:01:31.185
(A strong valid strike on each other)

01:01:35.455 --> 01:01:36.584
- Get closer. - Yes.

01:01:36.585 --> 01:01:38.794
Get closer.

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:41.225
Yes. You're hitting her.

01:01:41.325 --> 01:01:42.394
That's right.

01:01:42.395 --> 01:01:43.464
That's right. Use your stamina.

01:01:43.465 --> 01:01:44.625
Yes. Okay.

01:01:44.825 --> 01:01:47.065
(Round 1 ends.)

01:01:47.235 --> 01:01:48.565
- Good job. - That was good.

01:01:49.805 --> 01:01:50.934
(The opponent was superior in Round 1.)

01:01:50.935 --> 01:01:52.275
All good.

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:55.845
Among all the opponents she's met, I think she's the best.

01:01:56.105 --> 01:01:58.225
It was probably her first time getting hit like that.

01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:04.715
(Uie got punched hard throughout Round 1.)

01:02:04.815 --> 01:02:06.384
This is a very important experience.

01:02:06.385 --> 01:02:07.984
Right. I'm sorry to say this, but she needs to get hit.

01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:09.084
- Yes. - She's doing great.

01:02:09.085 --> 01:02:10.884
(Because they've gone through it, )

01:02:10.885 --> 01:02:13.725
(they're worried about her even more.)

01:02:14.155 --> 01:02:15.225
It doesn't hurt.

01:02:15.795 --> 01:02:16.894
- It doesn't hurt, right? - Yes.

01:02:16.895 --> 01:02:18.595
(Uie is as durable as her stamina.)

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:20.164
More relax.

01:02:20.165 --> 01:02:22.305
(Whereas the opponent is running out of breath.)

01:02:22.465 --> 01:02:23.605
You go to the body.

01:02:23.765 --> 01:02:24.904
- Up. That's two. - She's so long.

01:02:24.905 --> 01:02:26.204
Because she has taller...

01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:27.475
She has longer hands.

01:02:28.105 --> 01:02:31.145
And you have a really strong right hand. I like that.

01:02:31.305 --> 01:02:34.474
You don't jab. You just wait, so the opponent knows what's coming.

01:02:34.475 --> 01:02:36.914
When you jab, that's when she punches.

01:02:36.915 --> 01:02:38.554
- So jab first? - Yes, that's why you got hit.

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:39.584
If you're going to hit her, just hit her.

01:02:39.585 --> 01:02:41.265
- Otherwise, just get close to her. - Yes.

01:02:41.585 --> 01:02:43.131
- Uie, use all your stamina. - You're doing great.

01:02:43.155 --> 01:02:44.531
- You're doing amazing. - Use it all up.

01:02:44.555 --> 01:02:45.994
The opponent is gathering her energy before punching you.

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.571
But you have to attack her before she gathers it.

01:02:47.595 --> 01:02:48.665
Okay.

01:02:49.695 --> 01:02:52.595
(My sparring begins now.)

01:02:52.965 --> 01:02:56.335
(What kind of match will she put on in Round 2?)

01:02:56.705 --> 01:02:59.435
(Round 2 begins.)

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.445
Let's go, girls.

01:03:09.215 --> 01:03:11.615
(Uie approaches more aggressively compared to Round 1.)

01:03:11.685 --> 01:03:13.715
Jab. Punch.

01:03:14.485 --> 01:03:16.084
- Uie. That's right. - That's right!

01:03:16.085 --> 01:03:17.125
Yes. You got it.

01:03:17.425 --> 01:03:19.555
(Uie's signature one-two)

01:03:21.055 --> 01:03:23.995
(She chases after the opponent and flurries.)

01:03:24.295 --> 01:03:25.435
Yes. Go in.

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.734
Yes. Don't take a break.

01:03:27.735 --> 01:03:29.804
Then the opponent can't gather her energy.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.004
Right. You got it.

01:03:31.005 --> 01:03:32.304
It's all about your stamina.

01:03:32.305 --> 01:03:33.834
Keep it up. Yes.

01:03:33.835 --> 01:03:35.944
Now, she can't gather her energy. That's right.

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.044
Get closer.

01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:38.045
- Yes. - Way to go.

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:39.875
Your opponent is nervous.

01:03:40.215 --> 01:03:41.674
Get closer.

01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:42.844
Get closer.

01:03:42.845 --> 01:03:44.315
Keep it up. You're doing great.

01:03:44.685 --> 01:03:46.584
She can't gather her energy anymore. Oh, no. She got hit.

01:03:46.585 --> 01:03:48.061
Thirty seconds have passed. You have to go in.

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.155
She's gathering energy.

01:03:49.655 --> 01:03:51.284
- Yes. Get closer. - Yes, try one again.

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:53.424
- Routine One. - That's right.

01:03:53.425 --> 01:03:54.824
(Routine 1:1, 2, backstep, 1, 2)

01:03:54.825 --> 01:03:55.894
- Try Routine One. - One, two.

01:03:55.895 --> 01:03:56.895
- Again. - Yes.

01:03:57.195 --> 01:03:58.595
- Routine One. - You have to focus.

01:03:58.895 --> 01:04:00.764
(She chases her opponent...)

01:04:00.765 --> 01:04:02.405
(and throws a one-two.)

01:04:02.535 --> 01:04:03.565
- Yes. - You got it.

01:04:04.005 --> 01:04:06.374
(Followed by a cross-counter)

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.404
- Yes. - You got it.

01:04:07.405 --> 01:04:09.545
Hit. Yes. Good job.

01:04:09.805 --> 01:04:11.945
(The opponent is completely off guard.)

01:04:12.045 --> 01:04:13.514
She's exhausted.

01:04:13.515 --> 01:04:14.575
Don't stop.

01:04:15.445 --> 01:04:16.544
Look at the opponent. Yes.

01:04:16.545 --> 01:04:17.545
Now is your chance.

01:04:17.546 --> 01:04:19.455
She turned her head. Yes. She turned her head.

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:21.814
Move around. Don't stay. Move around.

01:04:21.815 --> 01:04:24.055
(Bombarding with punches)

01:04:24.355 --> 01:04:26.595
(Pushing to the corner and flurrying with one-two)

01:04:27.095 --> 01:04:29.895
(The opponent is clearly slower than before.)

01:04:30.095 --> 01:04:31.464
Circle out.

01:04:31.465 --> 01:04:32.595
Let's go. Thirty seconds.

01:04:33.295 --> 01:04:35.015
- The opponent wants to rest. - Don't stop.

01:04:35.665 --> 01:04:37.464
(Going straight to the opponent again)

01:04:37.465 --> 01:04:38.465
- Okay. - That's right.

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:41.705
(Throwing in a deep jab)

01:04:44.275 --> 01:04:45.515
- Go. - Get closer.

01:04:45.775 --> 01:04:47.074
- Go! - That's right.

01:04:47.075 --> 01:04:48.785
- That's right. Your stamina. - Hit her.

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.444
There's a big gap in their stamina.

01:04:50.445 --> 01:04:52.614
(Uie pushes...)

01:04:52.615 --> 01:04:54.885
(the opponent to the corner.)

01:04:54.985 --> 01:04:56.825
(Endless one-two)

01:04:57.055 --> 01:04:59.154
- That's right. - Keep punching. Don't stop!

01:04:59.155 --> 01:05:01.001
- Keep going. This can be a KO. - More. Why did you withdraw?

01:05:01.025 --> 01:05:02.225
More. Why did you withdraw?

01:05:02.495 --> 01:05:04.124
- Why did you withdraw? - Don't stop.

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:05.164
Why did you withdraw?

01:05:05.165 --> 01:05:06.294
- Get closer. - You have to get closer.

01:05:06.295 --> 01:05:08.095
- Go. - She's reviving.

01:05:08.165 --> 01:05:09.234
Yes.

01:05:09.235 --> 01:05:10.305
Last 40 seconds.

01:05:10.535 --> 01:05:12.405
- Go. - Yes.

01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:14.405
(Uppercut in the gap)

01:05:15.005 --> 01:05:16.044
- That's right. - Keep going.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:17.144
- Forty seconds. - Don't stop.

01:05:17.145 --> 01:05:18.175
Good job.

01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:20.144
(This time, Uie keeps pushing without stopping.)

01:05:20.145 --> 01:05:21.675
- Get closer. - Yes.

01:05:22.215 --> 01:05:24.084
(When the opponent...)

01:05:24.085 --> 01:05:25.955
(lets her guard down...)

01:05:26.355 --> 01:05:28.284
(A punch in the face)

01:05:28.285 --> 01:05:29.355
Yes.

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:31.254
Yes.

01:05:31.255 --> 01:05:32.295
Keep going.

01:05:32.955 --> 01:05:35.025
(The opponent's last counterattack)

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:37.265
- Get closer. - Hands.

01:05:37.295 --> 01:05:39.865
(She pounds her with a tenacious flurry.)

01:05:40.435 --> 01:05:41.935
- Stop. - Okay.

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:44.765
(Round 2 ends.)

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:45.905
Uie.

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:47.504
- That's KO. - She was amazing.

01:05:47.505 --> 01:05:48.875
That was incredible.

01:05:48.975 --> 01:05:49.975
- Good job. - What?

01:05:50.105 --> 01:05:51.604
- Take it off. - What?

01:05:51.605 --> 01:05:53.274
- Wait. - What? What is it?

01:05:53.275 --> 01:05:54.374
- Good job. - Is it over?

01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:55.645
- It's over. - Yes, it's over.

01:05:56.045 --> 01:05:57.045
Yet it's over.

01:05:57.046 --> 01:06:00.554
(The opponent did her best until she couldn't recover.)

01:06:00.555 --> 01:06:02.385
That is a good experience. All good.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:05.154
Applause to the two fighters who did their best.

01:06:05.155 --> 01:06:07.894
(The two fighters did their best in sparring.)

01:06:07.895 --> 01:06:10.294
Can you tell us how it was?

01:06:10.295 --> 01:06:12.165
Oh, my gosh. Look at my face.

01:06:13.495 --> 01:06:14.865
She's very good.

01:06:15.295 --> 01:06:16.734
She's very good.

01:06:16.735 --> 01:06:18.034
But so good.

01:06:18.035 --> 01:06:19.375
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:06:20.305 --> 01:06:23.044
Uie, you just sparred.

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.675
You looked different in Round 1 and Round 2.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:26.944
To be honest,

01:06:26.945 --> 01:06:28.944
- when she punched me, - Right.

01:06:28.945 --> 01:06:30.184
- it hurt, - Right.

01:06:30.185 --> 01:06:32.185
But I could endure it.

01:06:32.215 --> 01:06:33.284
- So... - Very good.

01:06:33.285 --> 01:06:35.214
In Round Two, I decided to give it a shot.

01:06:35.215 --> 01:06:36.625
So I went close to her.

01:06:37.085 --> 01:06:39.155
I think that was what worked.

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:41.524
Marbie, I think...

01:06:41.525 --> 01:06:44.295
you have a very strong punch.

01:06:44.365 --> 01:06:46.035
How long have you learned boxing?

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.435
Two months passed.

01:06:47.735 --> 01:06:49.004
- Two months? - Yes.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.965
- She's the same. - But why is she so good?

01:06:51.265 --> 01:06:52.534
But why is she so good?

01:06:52.535 --> 01:06:54.104
- It doesn't make sense. - She was born with it.

01:06:54.105 --> 01:06:55.234
- Like In Ah. - Like In Ah.

01:06:55.235 --> 01:06:57.945
My boyfriend. He's an assistant boxing coach.

01:06:58.045 --> 01:06:59.114
And he said,

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:01.014
"Hey, you. Fight." And then...

01:07:01.015 --> 01:07:02.084
(Cool)

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:03.914
- That's cool. - That's incredible.

01:07:03.915 --> 01:07:06.015
What did you learn before boxing?

01:07:06.515 --> 01:07:08.584
Back in high school, I played basketball.

01:07:08.585 --> 01:07:09.985
But I sing instead.

01:07:10.185 --> 01:07:11.254
A singer?

01:07:11.255 --> 01:07:12.424
What year did you debut?

01:07:12.425 --> 01:07:13.695
What year did you debut?

01:07:14.325 --> 01:07:16.625
- A singer? When did you debut? - The same.

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:19.395
I went on "The Voice UK 2017."

01:07:20.095 --> 01:07:22.664
She's also a very famous singer...

01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:23.864
in Korea.

01:07:23.865 --> 01:07:25.041
(The senior singer: Your punch was pretty good.)

01:07:25.065 --> 01:07:26.734
(The younger singer: I have a good punch.)

01:07:26.735 --> 01:07:27.775
Idol.

01:07:28.235 --> 01:07:29.344
- Do you know idols? - Yes.

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:30.574
- Yes. Of course. - K-pop?

01:07:30.575 --> 01:07:32.244
(Uie and Marbie. The boxing idols are formed.)

01:07:32.245 --> 01:07:33.714
- I'd say sister? - Sister.

01:07:33.715 --> 01:07:34.845
Sister.

01:07:35.815 --> 01:07:37.384
- So cute. - So cute.

01:07:37.385 --> 01:07:40.384
The coaches must've been impressed by her.

01:07:40.385 --> 01:07:41.454
What did you think...

01:07:41.455 --> 01:07:42.825
of their sparring?

01:07:43.155 --> 01:07:44.685
You're doing so good.

01:07:45.425 --> 01:07:49.095
So strong even when you got strong punches a few times.

01:07:49.295 --> 01:07:50.864
You still kept going. Nice.

01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:52.234
Nice. All good. You're so strong.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.235
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:07:53.465 --> 01:07:55.865
Same. Try to protect your chin with your shoulder.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.565
You fight like this.

01:07:58.265 --> 01:08:00.034
That's the exact same thing our coach said.

01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:02.244
- She has to raise her guard. - I know that.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:04.405
- But I can't do it. - Right. That's what happens.

01:08:05.305 --> 01:08:06.544
(Uie's third sparring results:)

01:08:06.545 --> 01:08:07.974
(Strengths: Dogged enough to counterattack...)

01:08:07.975 --> 01:08:09.214
(despite the opponent's attack)

01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:15.414
(After the one-two, she can flurry using her stamina.)

01:08:15.415 --> 01:08:19.654
(Points to improve: Her face is exposed due to the low guard.)

01:08:19.655 --> 01:08:23.895
(Points to improve: Her face is exposed due to the low guard.)

01:08:23.925 --> 01:08:26.034
Applause to the two fighters for their best match.

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.035
(Their sparring gave them major experience.)

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:28.294
- Thank you. - Yes.

01:08:28.295 --> 01:08:29.764
- Thank you. - The senior and junior singers.

01:08:29.765 --> 01:08:31.665
The senior and junior singers.

01:08:31.765 --> 01:08:33.405
The third sparring.

01:08:33.535 --> 01:08:35.544
Sae Rok versus Saengchan.

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:36.644
Please get ready.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:37.775
It's either do or die.

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:40.815
Yes. Come on, girl.

01:08:42.445 --> 01:08:44.214
(The biggest height difference among the sparring opponents)

01:08:44.215 --> 01:08:46.215
- Okay? Just stay strong, okay? - Yes.

01:08:46.715 --> 01:08:48.985
(Guard up.)

01:08:49.185 --> 01:08:50.884
Like this, okay? Strong.

01:08:50.885 --> 01:08:52.855
Not here. Here. Good.

01:08:53.325 --> 01:08:54.754
(Due to the difference in their reaches, )

01:08:54.755 --> 01:08:56.715
(he emphasizes the guard in case of a long punch)

01:08:58.725 --> 01:08:59.865
I can do it.

01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:02.334
Focus on what you've been doing, okay?

01:09:02.335 --> 01:09:03.364
I can do it.

01:09:03.365 --> 01:09:05.304
- Of course. - Undoubtedly.

01:09:05.305 --> 01:09:07.065

You're more than capable.

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:09.444
Keep punching.

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.974
And when she gets close, give a two and turn.

01:09:10.975 --> 01:09:12.844
Just focus on that, okay?

01:09:12.845 --> 01:09:14.075
Because she's short.

01:09:14.175 --> 01:09:15.314
- That'll get you win. - Okay.

01:09:15.315 --> 01:09:16.814
Even if you only do Routine One, you'll win.

01:09:16.815 --> 01:09:17.815
Okay.

01:09:18.485 --> 01:09:20.114
- Come forward. - Let's go.

01:09:20.115 --> 01:09:21.984
(Fighters to the center)

01:09:21.985 --> 01:09:24.085
Let's play fair, okay?

01:09:24.525 --> 01:09:25.555
Touch gloves.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.425
Corners.

01:09:28.255 --> 01:09:30.165

Yes. Routine One.

01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:45.255

- Yes. Don't take a break. - Yes.

01:10:00.595 --> 01:10:01.771
(Sae Rok continues to record valid strikes.)

01:10:01.795 --> 01:10:05.395
(The opponent struggles due to Sae Rok's long reach.)

01:10:05.525 --> 01:10:07.895
(As Sae Rok's flurry continues, )

01:10:08.165 --> 01:10:10.134
(the opponent decides to lower her aim.)

01:10:10.135 --> 01:10:11.165
Be careful.

01:10:12.235 --> 01:10:15.074
(Sae Rok's continuous valid strike)

01:10:15.075 --> 01:10:16.705

(Groaning)

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:22.744
(The opponent's strong body shot)

01:10:22.745 --> 01:10:23.745
Her punch is strong.

01:10:23.746 --> 01:10:24.791
A strong punch on her stomach.

01:10:24.815 --> 01:10:25.831
- She has strong power. - Go.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:27.955
Turn around.

01:10:29.085 --> 01:10:32.355

That's it. Good.

01:11:00.955 --> 01:11:01.984
See that?

01:11:01.985 --> 01:11:03.424

01:11:10.295 --> 01:11:12.165
Hit her in the face. Keep jabbing.

01:11:12.295 --> 01:11:15.234

Stop.

01:11:52.935 --> 01:11:54.834
One, two.

01:11:54.835 --> 01:11:56.155
(Sae Rok crouches as if in pain.)

01:11:57.345 --> 01:11:58.644

(A fatal blow to the exposed stomach)

01:12:17.395 --> 01:12:19.834
Try again. What's wrong?

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:24.105
(Sae Rok crashes down from the accumulated damages.)

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:27.775
(Standing 8 count)

01:12:28.175 --> 01:12:31.644
(She straightens up, )

01:12:31.645 --> 01:12:33.845
(but it doesn't seem easy.)

01:12:34.075 --> 01:12:36.915
- I've been hit there too. - She'll strike again.

01:12:37.045 --> 01:12:38.344

01:12:38.345 --> 01:12:40.685
(They cheer her on, )

01:12:40.885 --> 01:12:45.625

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.095
- Punch. - Again.

01:15:41.535 --> 01:15:44.464
(Keeping the opponent in check with jabs after attacking)

01:15:44.465 --> 01:15:45.904
- Yes, nice. - Hit and retreat.

01:15:45.905 --> 01:15:47.474
- Good. - Good. Jab.

01:15:47.475 --> 01:15:48.934
Jab at her when she moves in, and pivot out.

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:52.174
- Yes. Let's go. - Jab.

01:15:52.175 --> 01:15:55.045
(The opponent charges in on the coach's command.)

01:15:55.615 --> 01:15:56.685
Jab.

01:15:56.915 --> 01:15:58.344
- Retreat. - Sae Rok.

01:15:58.345 --> 01:15:59.584
She can't reach you.

01:15:59.585 --> 01:16:01.015
- Move around. - Attack.

01:16:01.685 --> 01:16:03.985
(The opponent keeps pressing Sae Rok.)

01:16:04.255 --> 01:16:06.225
- Here she comes. - Good.

01:16:08.255 --> 01:16:09.765
Guard up! Nicely done.

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.695
(Valid strike)

01:16:11.765 --> 01:16:13.034
(Dodging)

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:14.565
(Valid strike 2)

01:16:15.895 --> 01:16:18.135
You did really well. That was perfect timing. Try again.

01:16:18.465 --> 01:16:20.504
- Do it again. Keep going. - Stay on your right.

01:16:20.505 --> 01:16:22.605
Immediately. That's it. Now retreat.

01:16:22.675 --> 01:16:24.775
- Nice one. - That's it. Now retreat.

01:16:25.575 --> 01:16:27.375
(Valid strike)

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.845
- Retreat. - Nice one-two.

01:16:30.245 --> 01:16:32.855
(After striking the opponent, she even pivoted out.)

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:35.455
(Preparing for the right moment to attack again)

01:16:35.715 --> 01:16:38.725
Try again. You have to keep your eyes on her.

01:16:39.055 --> 01:16:40.455
- Right away. - Gosh.

01:16:41.155 --> 01:16:43.164
(The opponent blocks Sae Rok's lead hand...)

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:44.495
(and launches a valid strike.)

01:16:44.595 --> 01:16:45.864
Don't get scared.

01:16:45.865 --> 01:16:47.295
One minute to go. The final minute.

01:16:47.335 --> 01:16:49.835
She's going to attack you. Keep watching her.

01:16:50.035 --> 01:16:51.564
You're doing good!

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.334
- Let's go. - Block her attacks.

01:16:53.335 --> 01:16:54.511
(The opponent is using the same pattern.)

01:16:54.535 --> 01:16:55.804
(Sae Rok calmly puts her guard up.)

01:16:55.805 --> 01:16:58.075
Try it. Go in.

01:16:58.445 --> 01:16:59.845
- That's it. - That's it.

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:02.315
(A powerful straight)

01:17:02.445 --> 01:17:04.585
- That's it. - Nice.

01:17:04.885 --> 01:17:06.815
- She took a strong hit. - Pivot.

01:17:07.215 --> 01:17:08.215
(However, )

01:17:08.216 --> 01:17:11.455
(she immediately took a body shot.)

01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:15.895
(A fierce slugfest breaks out.)

01:17:16.025 --> 01:17:18.225
- Yes. Go. - Attack and retreat.

01:17:18.295 --> 01:17:19.565
- Good one. - Good.

01:17:19.895 --> 01:17:24.105
(The powerful straight punch slips past Sae Rok's attack.)

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.805
- That looked like a strong hit. - Again.

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:28.074
- Good. - Pivot.

01:17:28.075 --> 01:17:29.134
Don't forget.

01:17:29.135 --> 01:17:33.045
(While they're exchanging heavy blows)

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.374
That's it.

01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:37.514
(A solid cross)

01:17:37.515 --> 01:17:39.814
- Again. - Breathe, Sae Rok.

01:17:39.815 --> 01:17:40.885
Jump.

01:17:41.015 --> 01:17:42.925
- Jump. - One more time.

01:17:43.055 --> 01:17:44.484
It's the last 15 seconds.

01:17:44.485 --> 01:17:46.794
- Jump, Sae Rok. - It's the last 15 seconds.

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.424
(Using her last bit of energy, she attempts a jab.)

01:17:48.425 --> 01:17:49.425
(Groaning)

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:50.624
(Valid strike 2)

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:51.895
(Valid body shot)

01:17:51.965 --> 01:17:54.194
Retreat. Pivot.

01:17:54.195 --> 01:17:56.305
Retreat. Pivot.

01:17:56.435 --> 01:17:57.604
- Sae Rok. - Here she comes.

01:17:57.605 --> 01:17:58.734
Go for it.

01:17:58.735 --> 01:18:01.404
- That's it. Pivot. - Yes.

01:18:01.405 --> 01:18:02.474
Breathe.

01:18:02.475 --> 01:18:03.974
- Pivot. - Sae Rok.

01:18:03.975 --> 01:18:06.145
- Go for it. Nice. - Nice.

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:10.014
(Sae Rok throws punches until the very end.)

01:18:10.015 --> 01:18:11.185
Don't counterattack.

01:18:11.485 --> 01:18:13.214
- Nice. - Let's go.

01:18:13.215 --> 01:18:14.955
Nice.

01:18:15.015 --> 01:18:18.155
(Sae Rok pivots out as she throws punches until the end.)

01:18:18.225 --> 01:18:19.794
Straighten your back, then pivot out.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:21.824
- Stop. - Okay.

01:18:21.825 --> 01:18:23.025
(Round 2 ends.)

01:18:23.625 --> 01:18:25.265
- Well done. - Good job.

01:18:26.265 --> 01:18:27.695
- Well done. - She endured it.

01:18:28.465 --> 01:18:30.234
One punch landed perfectly.

01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:32.064
- Good job. - Gosh.

01:18:32.065 --> 01:18:33.504
You were so cool, Rocky.

01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:35.604
There was one punch...

01:18:35.605 --> 01:18:37.805
- The counter. - that was a clean hit.

01:18:38.545 --> 01:18:41.145
Sir, thank you.

01:18:41.545 --> 01:18:42.984
Thank you.

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:44.684
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

01:18:44.685 --> 01:18:46.314
- Thank you. - Oh, thank you.

01:18:46.315 --> 01:18:48.131
(Sharing the Korean-style gesture of gratitude)

01:18:48.155 --> 01:18:49.255
Goodness.

01:18:49.355 --> 01:18:52.054
When fighting her, Sae Rok was like a female warrior.

01:18:52.055 --> 01:18:53.154
But now, she's all polite.

01:18:53.155 --> 01:18:54.554
(From a fighter to Rocky Keum)

01:18:54.555 --> 01:18:56.194
I made a guess outside the ring.

01:18:56.195 --> 01:18:58.195
I'm sure of this when it comes to Saengchan.

01:18:58.295 --> 01:19:00.465
The way she throws her punches and moves...

01:19:00.565 --> 01:19:04.105
suggests that she started Muay Thai when she was 5.

01:19:04.165 --> 01:19:07.875
When did you start boxing or practicing Muay Thai?

01:19:08.205 --> 01:19:10.205
(Focused)

01:19:10.905 --> 01:19:13.115
I've done Muay Thai for about ten years.

01:19:14.215 --> 01:19:15.674
(What?)

01:19:15.675 --> 01:19:17.215
(10 years?)

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:19.144
- Ten years. - You were spot on.

01:19:19.145 --> 01:19:21.215
I was spot on, right? Ten years.

01:19:21.685 --> 01:19:24.284
I started Muay Thai when I was 12...

01:19:24.285 --> 01:19:26.495
and taught myself boxing through YouTube.

01:19:27.595 --> 01:19:30.065
(She's been in over 20 matches.)

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:33.835
(With strong kicks and punches, )

01:19:34.465 --> 01:19:37.235
(she's an unexpectedly skilled martial arts veteran.)

01:19:37.365 --> 01:19:39.334
- She's a veteran. - She should be proud.

01:19:39.335 --> 01:19:42.735
We're really different in height, right?

01:19:42.975 --> 01:19:46.814
Despite that, I got hit countless times.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:48.975
- Yes. - Getting hit on my body was...

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.885
Receiving body shots was…

01:19:53.015 --> 01:19:54.785
If I say this on camera...

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:58.624
- Would I be exposing my weakness? - The opponent...

01:19:58.625 --> 01:20:01.294
The opponent will...

01:20:01.295 --> 01:20:02.424
(I'm being serious.)

01:20:02.425 --> 01:20:04.365
No. Sae Rok has strong abs.

01:20:04.495 --> 01:20:06.264
- Did your stomach hurt? - My stomach...

01:20:06.265 --> 01:20:08.034
- I feel like I took... - Yes?

01:20:08.035 --> 01:20:11.004
- every body shot possible today. - I see.

01:20:11.005 --> 01:20:12.534
- Really. - It was a shock.

01:20:12.535 --> 01:20:14.335
It was painful too.

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:15.974
Until now, I'd been scared of getting hit,

01:20:15.975 --> 01:20:17.374
which kept me from moving in.

01:20:17.375 --> 01:20:19.274
Today, my goal was...

01:20:19.275 --> 01:20:22.214
to throw as many punches as I could until the end,

01:20:22.215 --> 01:20:24.785
even if I was scared and took hits.

01:20:26.255 --> 01:20:28.555
(During her first sparring, )

01:20:28.855 --> 01:20:30.454
(Sae Rok missed the timing and hesitated, )

01:20:30.455 --> 01:20:34.225
(allowing the opponent to land a hit.)

01:20:34.495 --> 01:20:36.424
(During the second sparring, )

01:20:36.425 --> 01:20:39.935
(she made many valid strikes.)

01:20:40.395 --> 01:20:42.234
(But her moves were still passive, )

01:20:42.235 --> 01:20:44.735
(leaving the opponent to lead the attacks.)

01:20:45.905 --> 01:20:51.375
(The sparrings had always left her with disappointment.)

01:20:51.545 --> 01:20:53.315
(And today, )

01:20:53.545 --> 01:20:59.115
(Sae Rok attacked proactively...)

01:20:59.485 --> 01:21:03.824
(and landed the most valid strikes.)

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:05.054
- Of... - You did really well.

01:21:05.055 --> 01:21:06.825
- everything I've done, - She did so well.

01:21:06.925 --> 01:21:08.524
That's the one I'm proud of.

01:21:08.525 --> 01:21:10.124
- Well done. - You did an amazing job.

01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:12.295
You did really well.

01:21:12.495 --> 01:21:14.735
I was so surprised.

01:21:15.435 --> 01:21:17.635
Even when she got a heavy punch to the body,

01:21:17.765 --> 01:21:20.674
she still found some power to stay in the ring...

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.275
and did so well.

01:21:22.735 --> 01:21:25.474
(During Round 1)

01:21:25.475 --> 01:21:29.475
(there was a standing 8 count due to getting hit by a heavy blow.)

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:33.684
(But Sae Rok overcame the pain...)

01:21:33.685 --> 01:21:36.784
(and fought until the end.)

01:21:36.785 --> 01:21:38.024
I applaud that.

01:21:38.025 --> 01:21:39.025
That's so good.

01:21:39.025 --> 01:21:40.025
Thank you.

01:21:40.655 --> 01:21:45.024
Because Sae Rok's arms are longer than her opponent's,

01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:48.634
if she uses that advantage and moves faster,

01:21:48.635 --> 01:21:55.604
it could become a lethal weapon for her.

01:21:55.605 --> 01:21:57.174
Yes. Thank you.

01:21:57.175 --> 01:21:59.104
(An objective feedback from the veteran)

01:21:59.105 --> 01:22:01.615
For me personally, defense is the best offense.

01:22:01.715 --> 01:22:04.414
Your chin is up, and your head is up.

01:22:04.415 --> 01:22:06.045
Your whole body is open.

01:22:06.355 --> 01:22:07.584
Total defense.

01:22:07.585 --> 01:22:09.254
Chin down. Hands up.

01:22:09.255 --> 01:22:10.525
Your area is closed.

01:22:10.685 --> 01:22:12.025
And like this, you can work.

01:22:12.255 --> 01:22:13.595
Yes. Beautiful.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:14.854
- You got it. - Okay.

01:22:14.855 --> 01:22:15.895
You got it.

01:22:16.155 --> 01:22:17.265
Protect.

01:22:18.395 --> 01:22:20.094
(Sae Rok's third sparring results:)

01:22:20.095 --> 01:22:21.994
(Strengths: Proactice attacks to land valid strikes)

01:22:21.995 --> 01:22:29.004
(Showing a willingness to use techniques)

01:22:29.005 --> 01:22:34.144
(Points to improve: Defense is slow after attacking, )

01:22:34.145 --> 01:22:39.485
(leaving her vulnerable to heavy strikes)

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:43.954
You performed well against a highly experienced boxer.

01:22:43.955 --> 01:22:45.124
Well done.

01:22:45.125 --> 01:22:46.624
- You were really cool. - For real.

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:48.054
- That was the best sparring. - That was a great match.

01:22:48.055 --> 01:22:50.394
(An intense sparring session recognized by everyone)

01:22:50.395 --> 01:22:51.865
Saengchan, I love you.

01:22:52.025 --> 01:22:53.134
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.395
Let's get ready for the last sparring.

01:22:55.435 --> 01:22:57.834
Seol In Ah versus Madeline.

01:22:57.835 --> 01:22:58.864
Get ready to spar.

01:22:58.865 --> 01:22:59.974
Okay.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.305
Let's go, Mad.

01:23:01.705 --> 01:23:03.305
Which one do you want, champion?

01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:04.544
(Laughing)

01:23:04.545 --> 01:23:05.545
This one is fine.

01:23:05.546 --> 01:23:07.275
I think this one will be better.

01:23:08.575 --> 01:23:11.314
(The opponent wears her gloves by herself.)

01:23:11.315 --> 01:23:13.615
Show your skills. It's good for you too.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.214
I think I should use my experience.

01:23:16.215 --> 01:23:19.084
Yes. Stay confident. Just start easy.

01:23:19.085 --> 01:23:20.555
- See what you're made of. - Okay.

01:23:20.955 --> 01:23:22.695
- Hit and don't get hit. - Okay.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.265
I think she's a little bit scared. Maybe.

01:23:26.065 --> 01:23:27.794
Out of the four,

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:28.795
I think...

01:23:28.796 --> 01:23:30.781
- she's the most experienced. - She looks good, right?

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:32.404
Fight like you always do.

01:23:32.405 --> 01:23:33.504
Stay calm. Don't worry.

01:23:33.505 --> 01:23:34.505
It's okay to take a hit.

01:23:35.435 --> 01:23:36.744
(It's my turn to fight!)

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.005
We'll start the match.

01:23:38.245 --> 01:23:39.675
All right. To the center.

01:23:41.115 --> 01:23:42.214
Fair play.

01:23:42.215 --> 01:23:43.245
- Okay? - Yes.

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.385
Touch gloves.

01:23:44.785 --> 01:23:45.845
Corners.

01:23:47.685 --> 01:23:48.955
Good luck, Seol In Ah.

01:23:49.055 --> 01:23:50.625
Okay?

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:52.025
Okay?

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:54.695
Box!

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.656
- Good luck, Seol In Ah! - Good luck, Seol In Ah!

01:23:59.495 --> 01:24:00.695
Good luck, Madeline!

01:24:02.095 --> 01:24:03.305
Good luck, Madeline!

01:24:03.965 --> 01:24:05.005
You're standing firm.

01:24:05.035 --> 01:24:06.575
Yes. Short jabs.

01:24:06.805 --> 01:24:08.275
(A low strike after a feint)

01:24:08.735 --> 01:24:09.905
Stronger!

01:24:10.105 --> 01:24:12.144
(A low feint, )

01:24:12.145 --> 01:24:13.674
(and then a high straight)

01:24:13.675 --> 01:24:14.844
- Nice. - Jab.

01:24:14.845 --> 01:24:15.885
(Another valid jab strike)

01:24:16.275 --> 01:24:17.814
(The opponent counters immediately.)

01:24:17.815 --> 01:24:19.215
(However, )

01:24:19.515 --> 01:24:21.454
(In Ah raises her guard quickly, )

01:24:21.455 --> 01:24:23.555
(evades the opponent's jab, )

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:26.854
(and keeps an eye on her movements.)

01:24:26.855 --> 01:24:28.255
She's taken aback.

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.665
(The opponent closes in quickly.)

01:24:34.765 --> 01:24:37.765
(In Ah moves across the entire ring to find the right timing.)

01:24:38.635 --> 01:24:39.665
- Nice. - She's good.

01:24:41.505 --> 01:24:43.374
(In Ah's guard)

01:24:43.375 --> 01:24:45.644
(The opponent's jab and body shot)

01:24:45.645 --> 01:24:46.875
(Dodging her straight)

01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:48.945
Guard up. Yes.

01:24:49.045 --> 01:24:50.084
That just now was great.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.744
- The opponent is good. - Right?

01:24:51.745 --> 01:24:53.131
- She seems experienced in matches. - Yes.

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:54.214
Here she comes.

01:24:54.215 --> 01:24:55.215
Block it.

01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:57.155
- Here she comes. Block it. Nice. - Look at her.

01:24:57.225 --> 01:24:58.801
- That was amazing. - Thirty seconds have passed.

01:24:58.825 --> 01:25:00.895
(In Ah looks for the perfect moment to strike.)

01:25:01.195 --> 01:25:03.225
(The opponent has her guard up.)

01:25:03.365 --> 01:25:05.094
(In Ah's high-low combination)

01:25:05.095 --> 01:25:06.225
(The opponent's body shot)

01:25:06.495 --> 01:25:08.135
(Another cross-counter)

01:25:09.935 --> 01:25:11.035
What a strong punch.

01:25:13.535 --> 01:25:14.574
(Dodge)

01:25:14.575 --> 01:25:17.874
(A tense exchange of dodges)

01:25:17.875 --> 01:25:19.144
- The two... - You're doing great.

01:25:19.145 --> 01:25:20.615
Are having proper sparring.

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:25.945
(Neither of them is taking their eyes off the other.)

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:29.255
(A suspenseful back-and-forth)

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:33.054
(In Ah attacks first with a body shot.)

01:25:33.055 --> 01:25:35.895
(The opponent counters with a high-low combination.)

01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:41.064
Here she comes.

01:25:41.065 --> 01:25:42.764
Do a cross-counter. Throw a straight.

01:25:42.765 --> 01:25:43.835
(Dodge 2)

01:25:44.265 --> 01:25:45.334
(Dodge)

01:25:45.335 --> 01:25:46.774
Both are...

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:48.374
(Parry, Dodge)

01:25:48.375 --> 01:25:49.435
Nice.

01:25:49.505 --> 01:25:50.645
That's it. Keep watching.

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:54.545
(Cross-counter)

01:25:54.845 --> 01:25:57.115
Yes. Just like that.

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:58.984
(Dodging and guarding)

01:25:58.985 --> 01:26:00.815
(An intense match)

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.454
The last 30 seconds.

01:26:02.455 --> 01:26:04.555
Thirty seconds. The last 30 seconds.

01:26:05.185 --> 01:26:06.795
(The opponent quickly moves in.)

01:26:07.555 --> 01:26:08.955
(Valid strike)

01:26:09.495 --> 01:26:12.525
(But In Ah retreats after a counterattack.)

01:26:12.895 --> 01:26:14.194
- Nice. - Yes.

01:26:14.195 --> 01:26:15.911
Backing up after a hit helps you dodge, right?

01:26:15.935 --> 01:26:17.364
How do you avoid that punch?

01:26:17.365 --> 01:26:18.434
Well done.

01:26:18.435 --> 01:26:19.435
Both of them are good.

01:26:19.935 --> 01:26:21.074
Just like that.

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:22.734
Nice, In Ah. You're doing great.

01:26:22.735 --> 01:26:24.444
Keep watching her. That's right.

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.044
(A well-timed cross)

01:26:26.045 --> 01:26:27.074
Yes. Keep your eyes on her.

01:26:27.075 --> 01:26:29.845
(In Ah stays focused until the end.)

01:26:30.845 --> 01:26:31.915
Ten seconds.

01:26:34.785 --> 01:26:36.924
(She blocks high, weaves, )

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:38.755
(and follows with a right hook.)

01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:42.294
(Dodging and guarding on repeat)

01:26:42.295 --> 01:26:43.424
(Cross-counter)

01:26:43.425 --> 01:26:45.524
(In Ah tries a one-two combination.)

01:26:45.525 --> 01:26:46.635
Stop.

01:26:47.265 --> 01:26:48.494
(However, she let the opponent land a hook.)

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:49.764
(Valid strike)

01:26:49.765 --> 01:26:50.834
(Round 1 ends.)

01:26:50.835 --> 01:26:52.065
Okay. Well done.

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:54.335
Good job. You did really well.

01:26:55.405 --> 01:26:56.474
Nice.

01:26:56.475 --> 01:26:58.844
(Round 1 was full of intense mind games.)

01:26:58.845 --> 01:27:00.075
When the opponent attacked,

01:27:00.115 --> 01:27:01.221
you countered at the same time.

01:27:01.245 --> 01:27:03.145
That was amazing. I'm serious.

01:27:03.315 --> 01:27:04.484
When you pivoted after the straight,

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:05.914
the opponent missed you.

01:27:05.915 --> 01:27:07.254
But what should you have done?

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:08.655
- A one-two combination. - One-two.

01:27:08.715 --> 01:27:09.785
A one-two combination.

01:27:12.855 --> 01:27:16.294
(After attacking, In Ah dodged with a pivot.)

01:27:16.295 --> 01:27:20.065
(However, she hesitated and missed her chance to strike.)

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:23.064
Had you done that, it would've been great.

01:27:23.065 --> 01:27:24.934
The opponent is a great boxer.

01:27:24.935 --> 01:27:26.234
- She is. She's really good. - Right?

01:27:26.235 --> 01:27:27.404
She watched you before attacking.

01:27:27.405 --> 01:27:29.835
It's a tight match between the two of you.

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:31.704
All good.

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:33.775
- It's okay? - Yes, so good. Beautiful.

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.614
Now, let her work.

01:27:35.615 --> 01:27:39.684
(Round 2 strategy: Quickly counter and guard when the opponent attacks)

01:27:39.685 --> 01:27:40.784
Close the distance.

01:27:40.785 --> 01:27:42.031
- "Close the distance." Okay. - Yes.

01:27:42.055 --> 01:27:43.884
- Show them. - Okay.

01:27:43.885 --> 01:27:44.984
- Girl, go. - Let's go.

01:27:44.985 --> 01:27:46.895
Let's go. And good food after.

01:27:47.155 --> 01:27:49.095
(Relaxed)

01:27:49.855 --> 01:27:50.865
Breathe.

01:27:51.425 --> 01:27:52.725
You're doing well, okay?

01:27:52.995 --> 01:27:54.165
In Ah, you're doing great.

01:27:54.665 --> 01:27:58.405
(Let's fight harder in Round 2.)

01:27:58.535 --> 01:28:00.935
(Round 2 begins.)

01:28:05.145 --> 01:28:07.415
(In Ah strikes as soon as the match begins.)

01:28:08.375 --> 01:28:11.584
(The opponent doesn't hesitate to counterattack.)

01:28:11.585 --> 01:28:12.745
(Valid strike)

01:28:12.885 --> 01:28:14.055
(Guard)

01:28:14.215 --> 01:28:15.255
(Valid strike 2)

01:28:15.355 --> 01:28:16.684
(The opponent's powerful right hook)

01:28:16.685 --> 01:28:17.725
Your head.

01:28:17.885 --> 01:28:19.654
(Unlike Round 1)

01:28:19.655 --> 01:28:21.195
(the opponent attacks relentlessly.)

01:28:21.695 --> 01:28:23.054
It's okay, In Ah.

01:28:23.055 --> 01:28:24.265
Stay calm and counter.

01:28:24.865 --> 01:28:26.465
- Watch out for the body shots. - In Ah.

01:28:26.695 --> 01:28:27.964
You're doing well, In Ah.

01:28:27.965 --> 01:28:30.905
(Keeping a distance from the fierce opponent)

01:28:32.005 --> 01:28:34.374
(Retreating after a straight)

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.504
Right now, In Ah.

01:28:35.505 --> 01:28:37.244
(In Ah's powerful straight)

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:38.245
- Yes. - That's it.

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:40.515
(Another intense exchange of blows)

01:28:40.745 --> 01:28:42.314
(The opponent's high-low combination)

01:28:42.315 --> 01:28:43.415
(Cross-counter)

01:28:43.815 --> 01:28:46.684
(The opponent's body shot, In Ah's straight)

01:28:46.685 --> 01:28:47.814
- You did everything. - You're doing well.

01:28:47.815 --> 01:28:48.855
You're doing great.

01:28:49.155 --> 01:28:51.155
The fact that you have your guard up is amazing.

01:28:51.385 --> 01:28:52.654
Nice one. Here she comes.

01:28:52.655 --> 01:28:53.725
That's it.

01:28:55.695 --> 01:28:57.325
(Valid strike, Valid strike)

01:28:59.825 --> 01:29:00.864
Here she comes again.

01:29:00.865 --> 01:29:02.095
- Endure it. - Your guard.

01:29:02.395 --> 01:29:03.834
Here she comes. Yes.

01:29:03.835 --> 01:29:05.081
(She tried a low body shot after guarding.)

01:29:05.105 --> 01:29:06.905
Chin down.

01:29:07.005 --> 01:29:08.035
(Staggering)

01:29:08.275 --> 01:29:09.905
- Nice. - Punch her.

01:29:10.805 --> 01:29:12.444
(In Ah's dodge...)

01:29:12.445 --> 01:29:14.174
(causes the opponent to lose her balance.)

01:29:14.175 --> 01:29:16.045
(But In Ah missed her chance to attack.)

01:29:16.315 --> 01:29:18.715
(The opponent regained her balance in the meantime.)

01:29:20.415 --> 01:29:22.184
(A series of fast strikes)

01:29:22.185 --> 01:29:23.625
- Okay. - Wake up.

01:29:23.785 --> 01:29:25.384
(Distancing herself with a wide punch)

01:29:25.385 --> 01:29:26.725
- Get a grip. - Attack.

01:29:29.455 --> 01:29:30.895
- Wake up. - Pivot out.

01:29:32.425 --> 01:29:34.895
(A rapid series of attacks from the opponent in an instant)

01:29:35.295 --> 01:29:36.734
(Getting hit in a flash...)

01:29:36.735 --> 01:29:38.834
(again and again)

01:29:38.835 --> 01:29:40.505
(The jab landed perfectly.)

01:29:41.435 --> 01:29:42.475
Retreat.

01:29:43.705 --> 01:29:44.875
Wake up.

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:46.305
The opponent is incredible.

01:29:46.475 --> 01:29:48.035
- She's great. - How did they find her?

01:29:48.075 --> 01:29:49.445
Really, she's amazing.

01:29:49.675 --> 01:29:51.185
Catch your breath, In Ah.

01:29:53.415 --> 01:29:57.185
(In Ah circles the ring to save her stamina.)

01:29:58.425 --> 01:30:00.055
Cross-counter. That's it.

01:30:00.195 --> 01:30:01.954
(She backed off after the cross-counter.)

01:30:01.955 --> 01:30:02.955
Yes.

01:30:03.225 --> 01:30:05.965
(A perfectly timed cross)

01:30:06.265 --> 01:30:07.394
(Valid strike)

01:30:07.395 --> 01:30:08.465
(Valid strike)

01:30:08.935 --> 01:30:09.995
You did it.

01:30:10.335 --> 01:30:11.865
- Well done. - You can do it.

01:30:12.265 --> 01:30:13.334
Go for it.

01:30:13.335 --> 01:30:14.374
(Valid strike 2)

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:15.375
Retreat.

01:30:16.905 --> 01:30:18.775
(Screaming)

01:30:18.905 --> 01:30:21.074
(Filling her eyes with determination again)

01:30:21.075 --> 01:30:22.115
Attack. That's it.

01:30:23.075 --> 01:30:24.084
Attack. That's it.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:25.085
(Valid strike)

01:30:25.085 --> 01:30:26.085
Retreat.

01:30:26.115 --> 01:30:27.515
Punch and retreat. Retreat.

01:30:28.985 --> 01:30:30.855
Counter! Just like that.

01:30:33.155 --> 01:30:35.595
(In Ah's powerful straight punch)

01:30:36.755 --> 01:30:40.234
(In Ah attacks aggressively.)

01:30:40.235 --> 01:30:41.795
Nice one. Just like that!

01:30:42.465 --> 01:30:43.465
Good.

01:30:43.865 --> 01:30:45.964
(She attacks again with full fighting spirit.)

01:30:45.965 --> 01:30:46.974
Duck.

01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:48.035
(Groaning)

01:30:49.105 --> 01:30:50.644
(A wide right hook from the opponent)

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.645
(Weaving)

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:55.275
(Body shot)

01:30:57.385 --> 01:30:59.015
(Full of dogged spirit)

01:30:59.085 --> 01:31:00.614
- Go. - In Ah.

01:31:00.615 --> 01:31:02.955
- It's okay, In Ah. - One-two.

01:31:03.085 --> 01:31:04.125
Come on.

01:31:04.455 --> 01:31:06.025
(Come at me if you can.)

01:31:06.125 --> 01:31:08.625
You're the best. You are doing really well today.

01:31:09.125 --> 01:31:11.224
Nice. I'm really happy.

01:31:11.225 --> 01:31:13.835
- Good. Let's try again. - Backstep.

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:15.694
(The opponent's body shot)

01:31:15.695 --> 01:31:16.695
(In Ah's cross-counter)

01:31:16.696 --> 01:31:18.604
(As soon as the 10-second signal rings, )

01:31:18.605 --> 01:31:20.735
(the two boxers launch their final attack.)

01:31:22.235 --> 01:31:24.304
- You're doing great. - That's it.

01:31:24.305 --> 01:31:26.505
- Well done. - Just like that.

01:31:26.775 --> 01:31:28.244
- Go for it. - Nice one.

01:31:28.245 --> 01:31:32.314
(Despite taking hits, In Ah fights until the very end.)

01:31:32.315 --> 01:31:33.785
Move around.

01:31:33.885 --> 01:31:35.785
- This isn't easy. - Five seconds.

01:31:35.855 --> 01:31:37.684
- Okay. Stop. - Nice.

01:31:37.685 --> 01:31:38.685
Thank you.

01:31:39.285 --> 01:31:40.924
- Thank you so much. - Awesome.

01:31:40.925 --> 01:31:42.955
Thank you so much.

01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:45.625
- Thank you. - Very good.

01:31:45.626 --> 01:31:47.835
- Thank you so much. So good. - Thank you.

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:49.365
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:31:49.835 --> 01:31:52.034
- Thank you so much. - You're a professional boxer.

01:31:52.035 --> 01:31:53.874
You're a professional boxer.

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:56.174
A professional fighter.

01:31:56.175 --> 01:31:57.605
(Laughing)

01:31:57.705 --> 01:31:59.974
- She's the best. - She's really good at boxing.

01:31:59.975 --> 01:32:02.245
Wasn't this random? How did this happen?

01:32:02.545 --> 01:32:04.915
Had we fought her, we would've been knocked out.

01:32:06.145 --> 01:32:08.154
(Gosh, I'm tired.)

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:10.585
Do you know that the opponent took more hits?

01:32:10.885 --> 01:32:12.254
She's an amazing boxer.

01:32:12.255 --> 01:32:14.725
Yet you caught her off guard more than she did you.

01:32:16.025 --> 01:32:17.125
She's too good.

01:32:17.425 --> 01:32:18.864
Why do I end up with boxers like her?

01:32:18.865 --> 01:32:20.864
In Ah, she was an outstanding boxer.

01:32:20.865 --> 01:32:22.595
- Right? - But you did better than her.

01:32:22.935 --> 01:32:24.164
- Great job today. - In Ah.

01:32:24.165 --> 01:32:26.704
You fought an incredible opponent.

01:32:26.705 --> 01:32:27.974
It was a valuable experience.

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:29.904
The boxers were drawn at random,

01:32:29.905 --> 01:32:31.404
and you faced a valuable opponent.

01:32:31.405 --> 01:32:32.474
- I agree. - Exactly.

01:32:32.475 --> 01:32:34.115
(The draw picked the right aces.)

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:37.045
She is decent. She was really good, wasn't she?

01:32:38.445 --> 01:32:39.585
She has grit.

01:32:40.785 --> 01:32:41.985
Well done, girl.

01:32:42.485 --> 01:32:43.824
- Yes. - Yes.

01:32:43.825 --> 01:32:45.685
She's strong. A surprise.

01:32:45.725 --> 01:32:48.124
The last sparring was between...

01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:50.595
- In Ah and Madeline. - Right.

01:32:50.925 --> 01:32:52.724
Each match kept surpassing the last.

01:32:52.725 --> 01:32:54.325
Please give the two a round of applause.

01:32:54.665 --> 01:32:57.164
- Thank you. Thank you so much. - The best.

01:32:57.165 --> 01:32:58.604
- First off... - You're the best.

01:32:58.605 --> 01:32:59.704
Thank you.

01:32:59.705 --> 01:33:01.705
(A rare praise, in Korean, from the foreign coach)

01:33:02.175 --> 01:33:05.644
Before I even ask how the sparring went,

01:33:05.645 --> 01:33:07.675
it's crystal clear. Madeline...

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:10.714
She's a real boxer. A professional boxer.

01:33:10.715 --> 01:33:12.515
She clearly has a lot of experience.

01:33:12.645 --> 01:33:15.214
I've been training in mixed martial arts for five years.

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:16.284
- Five years? - Five years?

01:33:16.285 --> 01:33:17.485
Five years. Exactly.

01:33:18.155 --> 01:33:20.455
(No wonder.)

01:33:20.555 --> 01:33:22.094
- And then... - How many MMA fights?

01:33:22.095 --> 01:33:24.094
- I've had 21 fights. - What?

01:33:24.095 --> 01:33:25.525
(About 21 fights)

01:33:25.695 --> 01:33:28.034
- She's an MMA fighter. - She's unbelievable.

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.495
What about your record?

01:33:30.735 --> 01:33:32.935
I've had 21 fights, and I've lost 5 fights.

01:33:35.035 --> 01:33:36.434
Sixteen wins, five losses.

01:33:36.435 --> 01:33:38.204
(An impressive record of 16 wins and 5 losses)

01:33:38.205 --> 01:33:39.275
Madeline.

01:33:39.505 --> 01:33:41.415
- Thank you so much. - We...

01:33:42.415 --> 01:33:44.515
(Relentless kicks...)

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:48.285
(and powerful punches)

01:33:49.015 --> 01:33:53.185
(A veteran among veterans)

01:33:53.285 --> 01:33:54.994
- She has strong punches... - No wonder.

01:33:54.995 --> 01:33:56.355
And fights in a high weight class.

01:33:56.425 --> 01:33:57.895
She's simply a great boxer.

01:33:58.025 --> 01:34:00.894
This will be a chance for In Ah to grow.

01:34:00.895 --> 01:34:03.765
The sparring was great. She's very strong. Yes.

01:34:03.865 --> 01:34:05.764
She's not just strong,

01:34:05.765 --> 01:34:08.305
- but her skill level is quite high. - Thank you.

01:34:08.975 --> 01:34:12.175
I wasn't expecting her to be so strong, so it was very surprising.

01:34:13.075 --> 01:34:14.274
(It's an honor.)

01:34:14.275 --> 01:34:16.314
- Seol In Ah... - Thank you.

01:34:16.315 --> 01:34:17.984
Is a famous actress in Korea...

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:20.614
and has been boxing for only three months.

01:34:20.615 --> 01:34:21.684
- A new boxer. - Three months?

01:34:21.685 --> 01:34:23.254
- Just three months. - Three months.

01:34:23.255 --> 01:34:25.554
Yes, let's go. Her new career is boxing.

01:34:25.555 --> 01:34:27.695
- Really? - Yes, let's go.

01:34:27.925 --> 01:34:28.994
- Yes. - A professional boxer?

01:34:28.995 --> 01:34:30.624
Now. Let's go. Yes.

01:34:30.625 --> 01:34:32.124
(Even a veteran has acknowledged Simba Seol.)

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:34.094
I was very impressed by your skills.

01:34:34.095 --> 01:34:35.234
You fight backwards.

01:34:35.235 --> 01:34:37.204
Some professional fighters can't fight backwards.

01:34:37.205 --> 01:34:38.905
- She's really good. - Thank you.

01:34:39.235 --> 01:34:42.134
Stay focused and train. Very good. I liked your work.

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:43.604
The coach just now...

01:34:43.605 --> 01:34:45.844
That scene really impressed me too.

01:34:45.845 --> 01:34:47.314
I don't know if you'll remember.

01:34:47.315 --> 01:34:49.044
Right around here,

01:34:49.045 --> 01:34:50.544
you got hit and must have felt the pain.

01:34:50.545 --> 01:34:52.315
But then you moved to about here...

01:34:52.445 --> 01:34:54.554
and signaled, "Let's fight over here."

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:55.614
- I did? - Don't you remember?

01:34:55.615 --> 01:34:56.685
Not at all.

01:34:57.855 --> 01:35:00.655
(During Round 2, after a slugfest, )

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:04.095
(In Ah took a heavy blow.)

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:05.324
(But she created distance by stepping back.)

01:35:05.325 --> 01:35:06.625
(Come at me!)

01:35:07.165 --> 01:35:10.365
(Showing off that she can continue fighting)

01:35:10.435 --> 01:35:12.664
I thought you had taken a hit, but suddenly you were like,

01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:15.275
"I won't dodge, so come at me."

01:35:15.375 --> 01:35:16.704
I felt it in my head.

01:35:16.705 --> 01:35:19.175
Gosh. In Ah.

01:35:19.475 --> 01:35:21.814
- You went up against... - I did.

01:35:21.815 --> 01:35:23.575
- a strong opponent. - Yes.

01:35:23.645 --> 01:35:25.584
Firstly, Madeline is super strong.

01:35:25.585 --> 01:35:27.484
I somehow kept fighting...

01:35:27.485 --> 01:35:29.615
strong opponents.

01:35:29.755 --> 01:35:30.984
But she had the most powerful punches.

01:35:30.985 --> 01:35:31.985
You're right.

01:35:31.986 --> 01:35:33.584
I thought she'd focus on my eyes,

01:35:33.585 --> 01:35:35.324
so I planned to intimidate her with them.

01:35:35.325 --> 01:35:37.765
Instead of looking at my eyes, she kept her eyes...

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:39.325
- on my legs and fists. - Yes.

01:35:39.365 --> 01:35:42.735
When I fight, I'm always looking at their chest.

01:35:43.565 --> 01:35:45.804
Because for MMA, it's full-body.

01:35:45.805 --> 01:35:47.435
You can see where people go.

01:35:48.105 --> 01:35:49.904
I've learned a valuable lesson from you.

01:35:49.905 --> 01:35:52.075
- You're a star. - Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:35:52.445 --> 01:35:54.874
(In Ah's third sparring results:)

01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:57.014
(Strengths: Hit-and-run skills and defense have gotten better)

01:35:57.015 --> 01:36:03.755
(Can stop attacks and take control with a cross-counter)

01:36:03.785 --> 01:36:07.254
(Points to improve: Misses instant openings)

01:36:07.255 --> 01:36:11.925
(Hesitating may lead to rapid counters)

01:36:12.025 --> 01:36:13.664
- Thanks, In Ah. - We're grateful...

01:36:13.665 --> 01:36:14.941
- We love you. - for such a match.

01:36:14.965 --> 01:36:16.794
If it had been one of us instead of you,

01:36:16.795 --> 01:36:18.234
we would have been knocked out.

01:36:18.235 --> 01:36:20.305
- For real. - I might've been taken to the ER.

01:36:20.405 --> 01:36:21.965
We wouldn't be able to return to Korea.

01:36:22.075 --> 01:36:24.274
Actually, the goal...

01:36:24.275 --> 01:36:26.304
- of off-season training... - Yes?

01:36:26.305 --> 01:36:28.915
- is for such sparring. - It was spot on.

01:36:28.975 --> 01:36:30.814
The plane ticket wasn't wasted.

01:36:30.815 --> 01:36:32.745
Exactly. That was what I meant.

01:36:33.285 --> 01:36:35.154
The sparring was what we were looking for.

01:36:35.155 --> 01:36:37.014
Please give a round of applause...

01:36:37.015 --> 01:36:39.684
to the two boxers for an outstanding sparring match.

01:36:39.685 --> 01:36:42.725
Seol In Ah and Madeline are so cool.

01:36:42.855 --> 01:36:44.424
We're truly grateful.

01:36:44.425 --> 01:36:46.124
Our boxers have matches next week,

01:36:46.125 --> 01:36:47.694
- For sure. - and being able to spar...

01:36:47.695 --> 01:36:49.794
with the best boxers was a great honor.

01:36:49.795 --> 01:36:52.404
Every sparring session felt like the best.

01:36:52.405 --> 01:36:53.464
- Yes. - Absolutely.

01:36:53.465 --> 01:36:55.474
So, breathe.

01:36:55.475 --> 01:36:56.974
I could see you were getting tired...

01:36:56.975 --> 01:36:59.275
because you were breathing very fast.

01:36:59.675 --> 01:37:02.444
Breathe slowly, and you'll have more energy.

01:37:02.445 --> 01:37:03.845
And you will win.

01:37:04.645 --> 01:37:05.684
Thank you.

01:37:05.685 --> 01:37:08.954
Listen to your coaches and trust your preparation.

01:37:08.955 --> 01:37:10.415
- Thank you. - Thank you.

01:37:10.885 --> 01:37:12.285
- Good luck. - Good luck.

01:37:12.625 --> 01:37:14.355
- Thank you. - Great work.

01:37:18.225 --> 01:37:19.894
Thank you.

01:37:19.895 --> 01:37:21.935
(After completing such rewarding sparring sessions)

01:37:22.065 --> 01:37:24.204
You were all so cool.

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:26.004
All four of us were amazing. We did really well.

01:37:26.005 --> 01:37:27.904
Before we analyze the videos,

01:37:27.905 --> 01:37:30.004
let's hear about the sparring sessions.

01:37:30.005 --> 01:37:32.104
Since they were foreign boxers,

01:37:32.105 --> 01:37:34.214
- I was a bit nervous at first. - Right.

01:37:34.215 --> 01:37:37.784
But I really liked how focused I remained despite being nervous.

01:37:37.785 --> 01:37:39.684
Even I could tell that...

01:37:39.685 --> 01:37:42.484
you were much more nervous in this sparring than in the others.

01:37:42.485 --> 01:37:45.354
Your eyes were wide open in the headgear,

01:37:45.355 --> 01:37:46.755
completely focused.

01:37:46.785 --> 01:37:48.894
It felt like all your concentration was focused...

01:37:48.895 --> 01:37:50.794
- I loved it. - on your opponent.

01:37:50.795 --> 01:37:52.024
Here's what I learned today.

01:37:52.025 --> 01:37:54.694
Smiling in the middle of a sparring session?

01:37:54.695 --> 01:37:56.194
That puts intense pressure...

01:37:56.195 --> 01:37:57.735
- on the opponent. - Exactly.

01:37:57.935 --> 01:37:59.704
If I ever get the chance to do it...

01:37:59.705 --> 01:38:01.705
(Smiling)

01:38:01.905 --> 01:38:02.905
(Madness skill has been unlocked.)

01:38:02.906 --> 01:38:04.145
At least once.

01:38:04.275 --> 01:38:05.504
I'll mess with it.

01:38:05.505 --> 01:38:07.205
- Someone's mind. - That's essential.

01:38:07.545 --> 01:38:10.985
After Coach Kim's review last time,

01:38:11.245 --> 01:38:13.815
I focused on trying new techniques.

01:38:14.215 --> 01:38:16.515
It's true that I need to adjust my techniques...

01:38:16.715 --> 01:38:18.624
depending on the opponent,

01:38:18.625 --> 01:38:20.124
but I became too fixated on my goal...

01:38:20.125 --> 01:38:21.924
and didn't think outside the box.

01:38:21.925 --> 01:38:25.695
I realized I shouldn't set a rigid goal before stepping into the ring.

01:38:25.965 --> 01:38:28.294
Either way, let's watch the videos of your sessions...

01:38:28.295 --> 01:38:30.805
and analyze your strengths and weaknesses.

01:38:31.065 --> 01:38:33.805
All right. We'll start with Ju Hyun's sessions.

01:38:34.235 --> 01:38:35.475
I will gladly accept feedback.

01:38:35.575 --> 01:38:37.705
Okay. What Ju Hyun was good at...

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:39.705
was throwing jabs...

01:38:39.905 --> 01:38:42.305
to provoke the opponent, so she could watch their rear hand.

01:38:42.845 --> 01:38:44.745
Ju Hyun kept that going.

01:38:45.515 --> 01:38:48.455
As you can see, Ju Hyun jabbed at the opponent's stomach...

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:50.255
and then landed two low blows.

01:38:50.315 --> 01:38:51.325
That was great.

01:38:52.425 --> 01:38:53.924
Watch carefully. Right here.

01:38:53.925 --> 01:38:55.194
(After watching the opponent retreat)

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.275
Punch. This is what I mean.

01:38:57.025 --> 01:38:58.164
That just now was amazing.

01:38:58.165 --> 01:38:59.925
(Stepping back while tracking the rear hand)

01:39:00.425 --> 01:39:02.434
If the opponent didn't attack, Ju Hyun would jab at her.

01:39:02.435 --> 01:39:04.635
She used jabs to provoke the opponent. Nice.

01:39:05.405 --> 01:39:06.834
(After a jab)

01:39:06.835 --> 01:39:08.074
Look. She's watching, right?

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:11.005
After throwing a jab, Ju Hyun kept looking at the rear hand.

01:39:11.645 --> 01:39:13.644
Retreating after throwing a punch was effective too.

01:39:13.645 --> 01:39:16.545
- Keeping the distance was great. - Ju Hyun is scary.

01:39:16.675 --> 01:39:18.915
Whenever I throw a jab, the opponent always responds.

01:39:18.985 --> 01:39:21.384
That technique works very well,

01:39:21.385 --> 01:39:22.561
and she executes it skillfully.

01:39:22.585 --> 01:39:23.985
Ju Hyun’s strength is that...

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:26.925
no matter which sparring session it is, she remains calm.

01:39:27.085 --> 01:39:28.124
I agree.

01:39:28.125 --> 01:39:29.795
She has excellent footwork...

01:39:29.855 --> 01:39:31.465
and has her own rhythm.

01:39:32.395 --> 01:39:33.465
Watch her.

01:39:33.665 --> 01:39:35.095
- Another one-two. - Nice.

01:39:35.165 --> 01:39:37.295
Move away. Yes, that's how you retreat.

01:39:38.665 --> 01:39:40.704
She's like, "Come at me."

01:39:40.705 --> 01:39:42.385
And then, she strikes. That's a good move.

01:39:42.705 --> 01:39:43.905
While moving sideways.

01:39:45.275 --> 01:39:46.344
That was great just now.

01:39:46.345 --> 01:39:47.845
(Backstep)

01:39:48.875 --> 01:39:50.815
Punch and retreat.

01:39:50.945 --> 01:39:52.315
She did an excellent job.

01:39:52.585 --> 01:39:53.585
But...

01:39:53.945 --> 01:39:56.385
But when exchanging blows,

01:39:56.855 --> 01:39:58.454
your punches tend to get big.

01:39:58.455 --> 01:39:59.455
Right.

01:39:59.655 --> 01:40:01.625
Move in. Come on.

01:40:02.025 --> 01:40:04.595
Watch closely. Your hand slips backward.

01:40:05.365 --> 01:40:08.194
- Look. It slips backward, right? - It moves outward.

01:40:08.195 --> 01:40:09.435
Exactly.

01:40:09.965 --> 01:40:11.135
Watch this footage.

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:12.665
You lower your hand.

01:40:13.565 --> 01:40:17.234
If you had tightened your punches during the consecutive hits,

01:40:17.235 --> 01:40:18.475
it would have been much better.

01:40:18.845 --> 01:40:21.945
You understand why I had you do ducking and hooks, right?

01:40:22.215 --> 01:40:24.215
I'll practice punching at short distances.

01:40:24.615 --> 01:40:26.614
And look at this footage.

01:40:26.615 --> 01:40:28.785
(Ju Hyun was cornered during the fight.)

01:40:28.985 --> 01:40:30.715
Yes, but in these situations...

01:40:31.355 --> 01:40:33.155
In these situations, you need to retreat.

01:40:33.785 --> 01:40:36.695
I clearly heard you telling me to move out.

01:40:37.095 --> 01:40:39.495
But I couldn't because of the rage from getting hit.

01:40:40.595 --> 01:40:43.635
I got struck right when I needed to retreat.

01:40:43.995 --> 01:40:45.864
But to retreat immediately? No way.

01:40:45.865 --> 01:40:48.275
With that, I tried to hit her more.

01:40:48.305 --> 01:40:49.605
That's incredible.

01:40:49.935 --> 01:40:51.045
That's true madness.

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:53.405
- I should've moved back, right? - Still,

01:40:53.475 --> 01:40:55.144
you can tell that you should've moved back...

01:40:55.145 --> 01:40:56.444
when you watch the video.

01:40:56.445 --> 01:40:58.215
- That's how you learn. - That's right.

01:40:58.285 --> 01:41:00.084
If you improve yourself in such aspects,

01:41:00.085 --> 01:41:03.055
you'll be ready for the competition.

01:41:03.455 --> 01:41:04.925
- You did well. - You did very well.

01:41:05.885 --> 01:41:07.185
You're cool.

01:41:08.825 --> 01:41:10.125
I survived today as well.

01:41:10.995 --> 01:41:12.024
Now,

01:41:12.025 --> 01:41:14.025
Uie is next.

01:41:14.365 --> 01:41:16.364
You need to pay attention...

01:41:16.365 --> 01:41:19.205
to which techniques your opponent used often on you.

01:41:19.605 --> 01:41:20.805
Look at this. Here.

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:22.135
Push, punch.

01:41:23.335 --> 01:41:25.775
(The opponent's attacking pattern 1: Parry, two)

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.044
(Low)

01:41:29.045 --> 01:41:30.215
(High)

01:41:30.885 --> 01:41:31.944
She kept going for low and high.

01:41:31.945 --> 01:41:33.061
(The opponent's attacking pattern 2: Low, high)

01:41:33.085 --> 01:41:34.115
All right.

01:41:35.085 --> 01:41:36.584
Walk, punch. Walk, punch again.

01:41:36.585 --> 01:41:37.754
(The opponent's attacking pattern repeated itself in Round 1.)

01:41:37.755 --> 01:41:38.901
Then she punched the stomach.

01:41:38.925 --> 01:41:40.124
She's fast.

01:41:40.125 --> 01:41:42.354
(Uie was helpless against the opponent's attacks.)

01:41:42.355 --> 01:41:43.795
She's blocking the attacks.

01:41:44.725 --> 01:41:46.164
Uie, you need to think about this...

01:41:46.165 --> 01:41:47.634
when you watch the video.

01:41:47.635 --> 01:41:49.964
- Okay. - "That's how the opponent attacks."

01:41:49.965 --> 01:41:51.364
"At which timing..."

01:41:51.365 --> 01:41:52.404
- "should I go for two?" - I see.

01:41:52.405 --> 01:41:53.564
Think about that only.

01:41:53.565 --> 01:41:55.305
Then you'll improve.

01:41:55.905 --> 01:41:57.805
However, you kept waiting.

01:41:58.005 --> 01:41:59.445
Then your opponent will read that.

01:42:00.145 --> 01:42:02.845
Then she thought about which techniques she should use.

01:42:03.915 --> 01:42:07.144
When I tell you not to attack first,

01:42:07.145 --> 01:42:10.255
I want you to make your opponent attack first.

01:42:10.715 --> 01:42:12.915
That's what I mean when I tell you not to attack first.

01:42:13.255 --> 01:42:14.295
Watch.

01:42:14.825 --> 01:42:15.855
Punch.

01:42:15.955 --> 01:42:17.394
That was nice.

01:42:17.395 --> 01:42:18.824
You punched from the spot.

01:42:18.825 --> 01:42:20.265
- You did it with confidence. - Yes.

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.965
- Your punch landed. - Well done.

01:42:24.765 --> 01:42:25.835
Another punch.

01:42:26.005 --> 01:42:27.405
Your one-two punches landed.

01:42:27.775 --> 01:42:28.805
You did well.

01:42:29.235 --> 01:42:30.974
You did well just now. You did really well.

01:42:30.975 --> 01:42:32.504
After that punch landed,

01:42:32.505 --> 01:42:33.905
your opponent couldn't come closer.

01:42:33.945 --> 01:42:35.074
(Flustered)

01:42:35.075 --> 01:42:36.375
The opponent became flustered.

01:42:36.975 --> 01:42:39.345
I think I became a bit confident at that time.

01:42:39.615 --> 01:42:41.314
You did very well toward the end of Round One.

01:42:41.315 --> 01:42:42.554
- That's right. You did well. - That was...

01:42:42.555 --> 01:42:45.425
because your punches landed on the opponent.

01:42:45.855 --> 01:42:47.624
- Thus, in Round 2, - Round 2.

01:42:47.625 --> 01:42:49.224
- I told you to keep going. - Yes.

01:42:49.225 --> 01:42:50.895
You were cool in Round Two.

01:42:51.295 --> 01:42:52.724
She changed as if someone pressed the button...

01:42:52.725 --> 01:42:54.395
- to turn on the booster mode. - I know.

01:42:54.435 --> 01:42:55.734
All right. Watch...

01:42:55.735 --> 01:42:58.204
how the dynamics changed in Round Two.

01:42:58.205 --> 01:42:59.265
Okay.

01:43:00.405 --> 01:43:02.004
Punch.

01:43:02.005 --> 01:43:04.204
Then you punched again.

01:43:04.205 --> 01:43:05.245
Retreat.

01:43:06.045 --> 01:43:08.075
Punch.

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:09.775
Your punches landed.

01:43:10.445 --> 01:43:11.614
You punched and moved back.

01:43:11.615 --> 01:43:13.921
(Her attacking pattern was the same, but the punches landed.)

01:43:13.945 --> 01:43:15.814
Uie, you just need to be good at punching...

01:43:15.815 --> 01:43:16.815
and stepping back.

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:18.084
- You're that type of boxer. - That's right.

01:43:18.085 --> 01:43:19.154
Her reach is very long.

01:43:19.155 --> 01:43:21.325
You can see how well you did, right?

01:43:21.495 --> 01:43:24.765
Every time threw a punch, it landed.

01:43:26.125 --> 01:43:27.164
You went it again.

01:43:27.165 --> 01:43:28.694
(Uie cornered the opponent with enthusiasm.)

01:43:28.695 --> 01:43:29.794
You went it again.

01:43:29.795 --> 01:43:31.135
You followed the opponent.

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:32.365
She got cornered.

01:43:33.905 --> 01:43:36.134
She's tired. She needed rest, but Uie didn't back down.

01:43:36.135 --> 01:43:37.475
That was why she got cornered.

01:43:38.305 --> 01:43:39.945
She put her guard down.

01:43:40.445 --> 01:43:42.475
She couldn't do the footwork.

01:43:43.275 --> 01:43:44.614
(With the same energy, Uie cornered her until the end.)

01:43:44.615 --> 01:43:47.485
Watch. Like that, you threw multiple punches.

01:43:47.585 --> 01:43:49.755
Had you done Routine One...

01:43:50.155 --> 01:43:52.285
Backstep, one, two. Had you done that,

01:43:52.355 --> 01:43:54.024
the opponent would've stood down right away.

01:43:54.025 --> 01:43:55.025
Watch.

01:43:56.225 --> 01:43:57.424
Like that,

01:43:57.425 --> 01:43:59.025
you dodged. You should've attacked then.

01:43:59.295 --> 01:44:00.365
But you ran.

01:44:01.035 --> 01:44:02.065
You ran.

01:44:02.665 --> 01:44:04.234
The opponent was tired.

01:44:04.235 --> 01:44:05.264
She took a lot of damage.

01:44:05.265 --> 01:44:07.804
That was why she threw the last punch.

01:44:07.805 --> 01:44:09.004
Had you dodged and attacked,

01:44:09.005 --> 01:44:10.234
she would've been knocked out.

01:44:10.235 --> 01:44:12.504
But you stepped back at that time.

01:44:12.505 --> 01:44:13.744
(Had it been a real match, she could've ended the opponent.)

01:44:13.745 --> 01:44:16.114
The thing is, my opponent put up her guard...

01:44:16.115 --> 01:44:17.314
like this.

01:44:17.315 --> 01:44:19.215
It was my first time seeing it in sparring.

01:44:19.415 --> 01:44:21.054
I didn't know what it meant.

01:44:21.055 --> 01:44:22.414
You were supposed to punch her.

01:44:22.415 --> 01:44:24.231
If that situation occurs during the competition,

01:44:24.255 --> 01:44:26.124
keep punching her.

01:44:26.125 --> 01:44:27.725
Punch her body.

01:44:27.795 --> 01:44:29.295
- Make her stand down. - Okay.

01:44:29.395 --> 01:44:30.795
- Understood. - You did well today.

01:44:31.095 --> 01:44:32.364
You were like different people...

01:44:32.365 --> 01:44:34.125
- in Round 1 and Round 2. - Seriously.

01:44:34.535 --> 01:44:36.264
The third one is Sae Rok.

01:44:36.265 --> 01:44:37.295
Okay.

01:44:37.535 --> 01:44:39.234
Did you see the body shot?

01:44:39.235 --> 01:44:40.265
Let's watch again.

01:44:40.965 --> 01:44:43.175
(Sae Rok)

01:44:43.775 --> 01:44:46.575
You took a body shot. Did you see that? Okay.

01:44:47.945 --> 01:44:48.945
Punch.

01:44:48.946 --> 01:44:50.044
It went in cleanly.

01:44:50.045 --> 01:44:52.185
(She took a body shot in an instant.)

01:44:52.315 --> 01:44:53.814
Why did you take the body shot?

01:44:53.815 --> 01:44:55.535
(The reason why Sae Rok took the body shot)

01:44:55.855 --> 01:44:57.054
Look at the hand behind you.

01:44:57.055 --> 01:44:59.654
(One arm was in the back.)

01:44:59.655 --> 01:45:00.885
Sae Rok,

01:45:00.985 --> 01:45:02.824
had you returned the fist to the original position quickly,

01:45:02.825 --> 01:45:04.155
you wouldn't have taken the shot.

01:45:05.925 --> 01:45:10.495
(Meanwhile, her body was exposed.)

01:45:12.605 --> 01:45:13.964
Watch.

01:45:13.965 --> 01:45:15.045
(In another two-movement, )

01:45:15.875 --> 01:45:18.245
(her arm was behind her again.)

01:45:20.405 --> 01:45:23.675
(Her body kept getting exposed to attacks.)

01:45:24.415 --> 01:45:26.385
What's wrong with her?

01:45:26.785 --> 01:45:28.984
- Why do I do that? - It's like...

01:45:28.985 --> 01:45:31.015
"Take my two!"

01:45:31.185 --> 01:45:32.224
"Take this!"

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:33.854
The opponent's coach told you...

01:45:33.855 --> 01:45:35.854
- To attack faster. - to attack a bit faster.

01:45:35.855 --> 01:45:36.924
- That's right. - Yes.

01:45:36.925 --> 01:45:38.365
This is the reason.

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:39.695
So,

01:45:39.725 --> 01:45:41.434
rub salt on your wound...

01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:42.695
- and recover quickly. - Okay.

01:45:42.795 --> 01:45:45.364
However, Sae Rok was not an easy opponent either.

01:45:45.365 --> 01:45:46.805
She got back up.

01:45:50.235 --> 01:45:51.374
(Even after she took another body shot)

01:45:51.375 --> 01:45:53.074
You kept throwing jabs.

01:45:53.075 --> 01:45:55.174
- That's it. Good. You did well. - You're doing good.

01:45:55.175 --> 01:45:56.175
She was so determined.

01:45:56.245 --> 01:45:58.344
She turned into Determined Sae Rok.

01:45:58.345 --> 01:45:59.944
(Determined Sae Rok refused to go down.)

01:45:59.945 --> 01:46:03.554
Also, I think today's sparring was good.

01:46:03.555 --> 01:46:05.325
After throwing a punch,

01:46:05.725 --> 01:46:07.261
you do a better job of stepping back for defense.

01:46:07.285 --> 01:46:08.324
After throwing a punch, you move this way.

01:46:08.325 --> 01:46:09.931
After throwing a punch, you move that way.

01:46:09.955 --> 01:46:11.725
(In the last sparring, )

01:46:12.265 --> 01:46:14.635
(Sae Rok punched once and got punched twice.)

01:46:17.165 --> 01:46:19.905
(She took so many punches.)

01:46:20.505 --> 01:46:21.835
Watch. Punch.

01:46:22.305 --> 01:46:23.305
Punch.

01:46:23.375 --> 01:46:25.005
You moved to the side.

01:46:25.275 --> 01:46:26.304
You moved.

01:46:26.305 --> 01:46:27.345
(She retreated.)

01:46:28.145 --> 01:46:29.174
Punch, punch, jab.

01:46:29.175 --> 01:46:30.414
(She puts a distance between them with jabs.)

01:46:30.415 --> 01:46:31.844
There you go. You ran again.

01:46:31.845 --> 01:46:33.615
You moved to the side again.

01:46:33.845 --> 01:46:35.655
Your defense after a punch improved a lot.

01:46:36.055 --> 01:46:38.555
She can attack and defend at the same time.

01:46:38.655 --> 01:46:39.754
That means...

01:46:39.755 --> 01:46:41.354
your stamina has improved.

01:46:41.355 --> 01:46:43.325
That's right. Since your stamina has improved,

01:46:43.395 --> 01:46:45.294
you can keep moving.

01:46:45.295 --> 01:46:46.594
After throwing a punch,

01:46:46.595 --> 01:46:47.724
you keep moving instinctively.

01:46:47.725 --> 01:46:48.765
You've improved.

01:46:49.395 --> 01:46:50.694
Your stamina has improved. It's good.

01:46:50.695 --> 01:46:51.855
Your timing has improved too.

01:46:52.235 --> 01:46:53.534
(Rocky Keum showed a noticeable improvement.)

01:46:53.535 --> 01:46:55.175
Your turn has improved a lot.

01:46:55.235 --> 01:46:57.235
- The last one is In Ah. - Gosh.

01:46:57.505 --> 01:46:59.145
My opponent was scary.

01:46:59.575 --> 01:47:01.874
The thing is, I saw you become a bit flustered...

01:47:01.875 --> 01:47:03.675
because the opponent was good.

01:47:03.775 --> 01:47:05.655
But your opponent was ten times more flustered.

01:47:06.215 --> 01:47:07.315
Watch.

01:47:07.785 --> 01:47:10.055
Slide. You guys exchanged jabs.

01:47:10.215 --> 01:47:11.224
Then you moved.

01:47:11.225 --> 01:47:13.955
Both of you guys had great footwork and rhythm.

01:47:14.355 --> 01:47:17.195
Like a fearless lion, you moved in.

01:47:17.295 --> 01:47:19.255
Let me tell you what I liked about this sparring.

01:47:19.465 --> 01:47:21.864
Back in the day, you did this when the opponent attacked.

01:47:21.865 --> 01:47:23.664
But now, you put up your guard in order to defend yourself.

01:47:23.665 --> 01:47:24.705
Here. Watch.

01:47:24.865 --> 01:47:25.865
(In Ah)

01:47:25.866 --> 01:47:27.835
(In the previous sparring, )

01:47:28.735 --> 01:47:32.205
(her head turned when she took multiple punches.)

01:47:33.275 --> 01:47:37.245
(Her guard went down against her intention.)

01:47:37.845 --> 01:47:39.284
(How is In Ah now?)

01:47:39.285 --> 01:47:40.344
Watch.

01:47:40.345 --> 01:47:41.715
After punching low and high...

01:47:42.285 --> 01:47:43.415
She did very well.

01:47:43.485 --> 01:47:46.155
You put up your guard as you watched your opponent.

01:47:46.525 --> 01:47:49.424
She was like a hyena. Gosh.

01:47:49.425 --> 01:47:51.095
You did well without getting intimidated.

01:47:51.725 --> 01:47:52.765
How cool.

01:47:53.525 --> 01:47:54.534
Watch.

01:47:54.535 --> 01:47:55.535
Watch. Here.

01:47:55.536 --> 01:47:59.164
I was like, "Is this the end? Is she in danger?"

01:47:59.165 --> 01:48:00.605
(She put up her guard and attacked.)

01:48:02.705 --> 01:48:03.834
The timing was great.

01:48:03.835 --> 01:48:06.404
(She put up her guard at the perfect timing.)

01:48:06.405 --> 01:48:07.445
Good.

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:10.615
I think she grew again.

01:48:10.775 --> 01:48:11.985
She's different from the past.

01:48:12.785 --> 01:48:13.785
In the past,

01:48:13.786 --> 01:48:15.114
- when she took the damage, - That's right.

01:48:15.115 --> 01:48:16.214
She either turned her head or stopped.

01:48:16.215 --> 01:48:17.284
- That's right. - She stopped. That's right.

01:48:17.285 --> 01:48:19.054
- But she continued to attack. - That's right.

01:48:19.055 --> 01:48:20.084
I realized then...

01:48:20.085 --> 01:48:21.231
- that she became stronger. - That's right.

01:48:21.255 --> 01:48:22.824
And when the opponent came closer,

01:48:22.825 --> 01:48:24.295
you threw a two. That was...

01:48:24.595 --> 01:48:25.794
That was very impressive.

01:48:25.795 --> 01:48:26.865
The timing was perfect.

01:48:27.425 --> 01:48:28.434
Watch.

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:29.995
You guys were watching each other.

01:48:30.365 --> 01:48:31.534
(Backstep)

01:48:31.535 --> 01:48:32.805
(Two)

01:48:34.305 --> 01:48:35.804
(She retreated...)

01:48:35.805 --> 01:48:37.004
(and threw a two.)

01:48:37.005 --> 01:48:38.105
It was so nice.

01:48:39.245 --> 01:48:40.674
It was great. Again, two.

01:48:40.675 --> 01:48:42.015
You punched as well. Yes.

01:48:42.615 --> 01:48:43.775
She's owning it.

01:48:45.245 --> 01:48:46.614
You went on until the end.

01:48:46.615 --> 01:48:47.695
You did well until the end.

01:48:48.915 --> 01:48:51.255
Even though the punch didn't land, it was great.

01:48:52.385 --> 01:48:53.754
Watch. You put up your guard.

01:48:53.755 --> 01:48:54.855
(Putting up her guard)

01:48:55.055 --> 01:48:56.094
That's it.

01:48:56.095 --> 01:48:57.555
You punched again.

01:48:58.565 --> 01:48:59.764
She did very well.

01:48:59.765 --> 01:49:01.605
(She focused until the end and threw a punch.)

01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:04.735
You threw a two, but the opponent cross-countered.

01:49:05.505 --> 01:49:06.665
She came closer.

01:49:06.835 --> 01:49:08.004
You guys had the same rhythm.

01:49:08.005 --> 01:49:09.304
Punch. Right?

01:49:09.305 --> 01:49:10.411
(The opponent threw a cross-counter.)

01:49:10.435 --> 01:49:11.474
Let's watch again.

01:49:11.475 --> 01:49:12.475
(They attacked at the same time.)

01:49:12.476 --> 01:49:13.916
Your opponent threw a cross-counter.

01:49:14.145 --> 01:49:15.674
And you took a hit.

01:49:15.675 --> 01:49:17.315
(Valid strike)

01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:19.284
(The opponent's cross-counter landed.)

01:49:19.285 --> 01:49:21.785
Despite the cross-counter, you did well. It's okay.

01:49:22.115 --> 01:49:23.814
You just need to practice...

01:49:23.815 --> 01:49:25.385
- the cross-counter. - Okay.

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:28.155
Yes. In Ah, you did well until the end.

01:49:28.925 --> 01:49:30.755
It's fun. I want to do it again.

01:49:31.095 --> 01:49:32.964
I think it's good as long as you do your best...

01:49:32.965 --> 01:49:34.494
in the ring.

01:49:34.495 --> 01:49:36.164
In my opinion, everyone did that today.

01:49:36.165 --> 01:49:37.394
- That's right. - Seriously.

01:49:37.395 --> 01:49:39.135
That's why I'm in a good mood today.

01:49:39.665 --> 01:49:41.434
- Everyone did well today. - It's so nice.

01:49:41.435 --> 01:49:44.504
I didn't know that our coach had so many straight teeth.

01:49:44.505 --> 01:49:45.645
- Please smile. - I see.

01:49:45.745 --> 01:49:47.845
I'm really satisfied with today's sparring.

01:49:48.445 --> 01:49:49.544
Seriously.

01:49:49.545 --> 01:49:51.444
- Thank you. - I'm close to tears.

01:49:51.445 --> 01:49:53.015
Coach's compliment is sweet.

01:49:53.115 --> 01:49:54.785
- It's so rare. - Yes.

01:49:56.385 --> 01:49:59.354
(The first day at Phuket nears its end.)

01:49:59.355 --> 01:50:00.385
Let's go.

01:50:01.695 --> 01:50:04.995
(Iron Girls head over to the lodging after the training.)

01:50:05.995 --> 01:50:07.295
We've arrived at the lodging.

01:50:07.365 --> 01:50:08.695
Let's go.

01:50:09.795 --> 01:50:11.565
- I'm curious. - Let's go.

01:50:15.635 --> 01:50:16.675
(Exclaiming)

01:50:17.605 --> 01:50:19.345
Is it a two-story house?

01:50:20.675 --> 01:50:22.245
- It looks nice. - Gosh.

01:50:22.715 --> 01:50:24.315
You look nice

01:50:24.685 --> 01:50:27.485
(The lodging makes them sing.)

01:50:27.885 --> 01:50:31.255
(They finally enter the lodging.)

01:50:31.485 --> 01:50:33.485
(Exclaiming)

01:50:34.085 --> 01:50:35.695
- What? - Gosh.

01:50:36.025 --> 01:50:37.495
- Why is it so big? - What?

01:50:37.825 --> 01:50:39.164
This is insane. What's this?

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:40.865
(What's this?)

01:50:40.995 --> 01:50:43.764
- It's so nice. I can't believe it. - What's this?

01:50:43.765 --> 01:50:45.735
I want to jump into it right away.

01:50:45.965 --> 01:50:47.235
It's fancy.

01:50:48.705 --> 01:50:51.675
(This is where the Iron Girls will be staying today.)

01:50:52.275 --> 01:50:53.904
(The Phuket trip finally feels like a vacation, )

01:50:53.905 --> 01:50:55.574
(after they've been training all day.)

01:50:55.575 --> 01:50:57.175
This is so cool.

01:50:57.615 --> 01:51:00.945
This feels like the house of a crime boss.

01:51:01.245 --> 01:51:02.955
- What is this place? - I love it here.

01:51:03.215 --> 01:51:05.354
- Whose house is this? - Is this a model home.

01:51:05.355 --> 01:51:07.054
Wait, I want to go inside the pool.

01:51:07.055 --> 01:51:08.624
I can't believe we get to stay here.

01:51:08.625 --> 01:51:09.725
This place is amazing.

01:51:10.055 --> 01:51:11.294
- Gosh. - Seriously. This place is great.

01:51:11.295 --> 01:51:13.135
I've never stayed at a place like this before.

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:16.235
(What in the world?)

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:18.104
- There's a pool table. - What?

01:51:18.105 --> 01:51:21.004
- There's a pool table here? - What's going on?

01:51:21.005 --> 01:51:22.235
Gosh.

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:23.905
Look at that painting.

01:51:24.105 --> 01:51:25.804
- What is this place? - This house feels so romantic.

01:51:25.805 --> 01:51:27.104
How many rooms are there?

01:51:27.105 --> 01:51:29.075
(The enormous living room)

01:51:31.445 --> 01:51:34.015
(The neatly organized bedroom)

01:51:35.385 --> 01:51:40.085
(The Iron Girls made it through a grueling day, )

01:51:41.055 --> 01:51:44.195
(and this house will help them relax and recharge.)

01:51:44.495 --> 01:51:46.924
(Gosh, I'm so excited.)

01:51:46.925 --> 01:51:48.895
(Gosh, I'm so excited.)

01:51:48.935 --> 01:51:49.994
I love it here.

01:51:49.995 --> 01:51:52.265
I can’t get over how nice this place is.

01:51:52.935 --> 01:51:53.964
This place is incredible.

01:51:53.965 --> 01:51:56.134
This is way too generous. What do they have in store for us tomorrow?

01:51:56.135 --> 01:51:57.735
I'm scared about tomorrow.

01:51:58.075 --> 01:51:59.345
What if we get beaten up?

01:51:59.405 --> 01:52:01.404
Honestly, if this is the price for getting beaten up,

01:52:01.405 --> 01:52:03.045
I'm okay with that.

01:52:03.375 --> 01:52:04.784
- Me too. - Me too. I'd rather be beaten up...

01:52:04.785 --> 01:52:06.085
- and live here. - Me too.

01:52:06.485 --> 01:52:09.514
Gosh. Hey! In Ah. Ju Hyun.

01:52:09.515 --> 01:52:11.185
Isn't this a mangosteen?

01:52:11.685 --> 01:52:14.555
We've been wanting to eat this.

01:52:14.655 --> 01:52:15.755
Mangosteen.

01:52:16.325 --> 01:52:17.495
Mangosteen.

01:52:18.795 --> 01:52:20.224
(Ju Hyun takes a seat at the table.)

01:52:20.225 --> 01:52:21.835
I'm suddenly feeling energized.

01:52:22.665 --> 01:52:25.905
(She starts fueling her body with mangosteen.)

01:52:26.365 --> 01:52:29.275
(Nibbling)

01:52:29.575 --> 01:52:30.774
This is really good.

01:52:30.775 --> 01:52:32.645
(Sae Rok joins her.)

01:52:33.205 --> 01:52:34.815
(Delicious)

01:52:35.275 --> 01:52:36.544
Forget about showering.

01:52:36.545 --> 01:52:38.145
- This mangosteen is my priority. - Yes.

01:52:38.515 --> 01:52:40.645
It’s so perfectly ripe.

01:52:40.815 --> 01:52:42.685
I can't stop eating it.

01:52:42.785 --> 01:52:43.884
- Stop. - No, Ju Hyun.

01:52:43.885 --> 01:52:45.025
Eat the rest tomorrow.

01:52:45.455 --> 01:52:48.055
- Seriously, finish it tomorrow. - She's already gone through it.

01:52:48.085 --> 01:52:49.094
(Ju Hyun finished the mangosteen already.)

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:50.224
We really have to shower and go to sleep.

01:52:50.225 --> 01:52:51.585
You have to eat the rest tomorrow.

01:52:51.825 --> 01:52:53.325
Why do I feel so energized?

01:52:53.425 --> 01:52:55.065
- Is it because of the mangosteen? - Yes.

01:52:55.295 --> 01:52:56.365
Let's shower.

01:52:57.965 --> 01:53:01.165
(The Iron Girls have gathered in the living room again.)

01:53:01.535 --> 01:53:03.274
She's so funny. Whenever I say something,

01:53:03.275 --> 01:53:06.244
she goes, "What?" or "That's not the point."

01:53:06.245 --> 01:53:08.815
Uie always says, "You got this!" "You got this, Sae Rok!"

01:53:09.115 --> 01:53:11.914
Always with a smile on her face. "You got this!"

01:53:11.915 --> 01:53:13.955
Meanwhile, I'm the worst coward in the boxing ring.

01:53:14.615 --> 01:53:15.815
I get so intimidated.

01:53:16.085 --> 01:53:19.785
(Even after a whole day together, the conversation never stops.)

01:53:19.985 --> 01:53:22.024
Uie, teach us how to dance.

01:53:22.025 --> 01:53:23.294
Yes, teach us how to dance.

01:53:23.295 --> 01:53:24.624
How do we do this?

01:53:24.625 --> 01:53:26.524
You're doing it right.

01:53:26.525 --> 01:53:27.894
But you look...

01:53:27.895 --> 01:53:30.665
(Girls’ night is in full swing.)

01:53:31.235 --> 01:53:33.134
(Iron School, let's go! Featuring After School)

01:53:33.135 --> 01:53:34.765
You’ve been doing jump rope since then.

01:53:36.175 --> 01:53:38.075
- Diva - Diva

01:53:39.005 --> 01:53:41.915
(The choreography is ingrained in her body.)

01:53:42.945 --> 01:53:44.115
Gosh, that's Uie!

01:53:44.445 --> 01:53:46.014
That's Uie of After School!

01:53:46.015 --> 01:53:48.985
(She's exuding her idol energy.)

01:53:51.115 --> 01:53:54.925
(You're doing great, Kim Uie.)

01:53:56.995 --> 01:53:59.565
- Amazing! - You're awesome.

01:54:00.225 --> 01:54:01.464
(In awe)

01:54:01.465 --> 01:54:03.565
Gosh, that was amazing.

01:54:03.965 --> 01:54:06.864
- Show us some more. - You're so cool.

01:54:06.865 --> 01:54:08.004
That's all I remember.

01:54:08.005 --> 01:54:10.034
- That was so impressive. - Your stamina is incredible.

01:54:10.035 --> 01:54:12.675
(Uie, your stamina is incredible.)

01:54:13.775 --> 01:54:15.644
I'm so glad I decided to do Iron Girls.

01:54:15.645 --> 01:54:16.844
(On the first night in Phuket, )

01:54:16.845 --> 01:54:19.845
(their conversations carried on late into the night.)

01:54:20.063 --> 01:54:22.093
(Day 2 of the Phuket Training Camp)

01:54:22.193 --> 01:54:23.963
(He is waiting for the Iron Girls.)

01:54:24.133 --> 01:54:26.333
(A boxing world champion?)

01:54:26.403 --> 01:54:28.503
I can't believe we get to meet a world champion.

01:54:29.333 --> 01:54:32.103
(The world’s number 1 boxer)

01:54:32.243 --> 01:54:33.542
You'll be sparring against me.

01:54:33.543 --> 01:54:35.143
(Are we sparring with her?)

01:54:36.173 --> 01:54:37.243
She disappeared.

01:54:37.613 --> 01:54:39.913
(Which Iron Girl will get the champion’s approval?)

01:54:41.343 --> 01:54:43.713
(Finally)

01:54:44.783 --> 01:54:47.653
(The highly anticipated first competition)

01:54:48.323 --> 01:54:49.453
My heart is pounding.

01:54:52.493 --> 01:54:53.523
I can do this.

01:54:54.323 --> 01:54:55.463
I can do this.

01:55:00.103 --> 01:55:03.703
(Time to see all that hard work pay off)

01:55:05.543 --> 01:55:06.702
In the Red Corner,

01:55:06.703 --> 01:55:08.973
Geum Sae Rok of Iron Girls.

01:55:11.343 --> 01:55:13.242
- You got this! - You got this!

01:55:13.243 --> 01:55:15.813
(They have 3 minutes to showcase...)

01:55:16.153 --> 01:55:18.434
(all the hard work and sacrifice from the past 3 months.)

01:55:18.853 --> 01:55:19.923
She must be so nervous.

01:55:22.193 --> 01:55:26.063
(Will the Iron Girls be able to become champions?)
