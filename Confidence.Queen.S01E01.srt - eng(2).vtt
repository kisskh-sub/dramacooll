EPISODE 1

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.136
The urban jungle moves at a pace so
frantic that no one has a moment to spare.

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:58.392
If you were to describe the mankind
that lives there in a single phrase...

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:03.439
Homo Laundrycus.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:05.316
The laundering human.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:11.030
Until the day we die,
the laundry piles up again and again.

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:17.203
And mankind's effort to wash away
that filthy grime? It's never stopped.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.039
Gu Pan-su, known as the Coin King,

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:22.416
was arrested for manipulating
the cryptocurrency market.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.960
On appeal, he received a fine
and a suspended sentence.

00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:29.215
The ruling has sparked debate among
victims over restitution and compensation.

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:34.386
You can just toss dirty laundry
into the washing machine.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.390
But what do you do with people
who are a lost cause?

00:01:38.474 --> 00:01:42.603
The Sand Foundation held a community
service event at Sand Haven,

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.605
a child welfare center
in Gyeonggi Province.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:47.441
To mark the center's 10th anniversary,

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:51.195
Chairman Jeon Tae-su and 20 employees
took part in volunteer activities

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.406
and gifted sports equipment
they purchased with the donations.

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:57.576
Welcome to my world.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.518
You're covered in ashes.

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:25.354
No matter how hard you try
to brush it off, it can't be shaken off.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.022
What? What do you mean...

00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:38.909
This is uncontrollable.

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.746
Yes. Every time she takes an exam,
she starts coughing.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.000
She once got kicked out
so she wouldn't disturb other students.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.127
Mom. That's because of asthma...

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.340
-A ghost burned to death is on her.
-What?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.844
It must be purged from deep within.

00:02:57.553 --> 00:02:59.805
Does that mean we need
to perform a ritual?

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.309
Mark my words or grave misfortune
will strike in November.

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:07.855
We can't afford a ritual right now.

00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:13.277
This is about saving her life,
and yet you're talking about money?

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.574
Mr. Kim.

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:20.284
Mr. Kim!

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.243
Yes.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:27.875
Get them out of my sight now.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.587
How dare you bring these fools
into the holy shrine?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.713
I'm sorry.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.341
-Ye-sol, let's go. Ma'am, come with me.
-Wait...

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:39.470
-I didn't mean any disrespect.
-Disrespect? Leave now.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.888
Get out of my sight!

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:44.266
If the truth doesn't get through
that thick skull, maybe some salt will.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.977
Mr. Kim, throw salt at them. Salt!

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:48.729
Come with me. Let's go.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.576
Usually, she's fine like that.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:07.539
Ma'am, don't worry
about what she said earlier.

00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:12.628
Ye-sol just needs to get a few more points
to get into a med school in the city.

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:14.338
So I pushed you too hard, I guess.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.674
My apologies
for making you go through that.

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:19.218
You don't need to apologize.

00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:22.429
I know you're worried about my daughter.

00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:26.600
-It's here.
-Yes.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:28.852
-Ye-sol.
-Ye-sol.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.020
Ma'am, take care.

00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:37.236
Gosh, it's so tight.

00:04:39.697 --> 00:04:42.574
Kim Deok-pil, nice.

00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:44.493
That should be enough
to reel her in, right?

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.079
Hop in.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.460
She'll send the money
by the end of the day.

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:58.048
That's the thing about the poor.
Their money is as light as a feather.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:01.760
Even the neighborhood
they live in is a total dump.

00:05:01.844 --> 00:05:03.470
Are you sure this is worth it?

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.353
You have a long way to go, Mr. Kim.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:16.066
It's easier to manipulate the poor.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.903
They barely make a living,
yet they're so greedy.

00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:21.905
So they go all in on their kids.

00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:28.495
I bet that woman will even sell
her store to send me the money.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:30.581
You think so?

00:05:30.664 --> 00:05:33.000
If that doesn't work out,

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:36.378
I bet she'd leave her kid
with her own life insurance payout.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.675
Gosh, you make brutal jokes.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:50.100
IM MI-SEON
DEPOSIT: 20,000,000

00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:51.060
See that?

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.282
That woman is shameless.

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:59.044
There's only one way to win this game.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.590
Don't be fooled by what you see.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:09.304
What you see right now may be real...

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:18.981
But it can also be fake.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:22.484
Oh, my.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.783
Ma'am. I'm honored to meet you again.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:32.953
I appreciate the warm welcome.

00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:37.457
You look even more elegant
and beautiful today.

00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.668
People would laugh if they heard that.

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:44.923
I mean, why else would a young boyfriend
like him be chasing after you?

00:07:47.176 --> 00:07:48.385
She's laying it on thick.

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:57.853
Red!

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.316
This is our signature game,
a modern take on juryeonggu

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.652
that our ancestors used to play
while drinking.

00:08:05.736 --> 00:08:07.946
The chance is 50-50.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.240
The simpler the game is,
the more your blood boils.

00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:15.621
That's what I like.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.017
White or red.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.688
Do you want to go
with the moon or the sun?

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:43.565
White.

00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:46.360
Go with white for now.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:49.655
-Let's go.
-No.

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.990
-Hey.
-Anyone else who wants to bet?

00:08:55.244 --> 00:08:56.954
Then we'll check.

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:04.670
White!

00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:08.382
White!

00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:23.146
White or red.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.565
What's your choice?

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:27.734
-Yes!
-All right. Let's do this.

00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:30.362
Red.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.033
Red!

00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:37.577
-Red!
-Red!

00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:41.957
-White!
-White!

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.583
White!

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.420
Red!

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.630
We're rich now!

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:51.967
2 WEEKS AGO

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:58.140
So this is how someone of your stature
enjoys their leisure.

00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.187
We got you something we knew you'd like.

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:07.524
-Call it a gesture of goodwill.
-You shouldn't have.

00:10:10.152 --> 00:10:13.113
-Oh, this is so precious.
-That was just a bonus.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.033
This is the highlight.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.493
What is this?

00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:25.250
It's a waste of talent for
the great Gwiyisu of Paldalsan Mountain,

00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:28.795
who once ruled the scene,
to put up with a young wench.

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:33.467
Why don't we strip your boss clean

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.052
and set up our own joint?

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.558
White and red sound different.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:43.643
Red.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.438
Red!

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.023
Red!

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:49.191
Red!

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.153
You should stop here for today.

00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:59.951
Don't be like this.
Let me play a little more.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:04.081
Gambling is meant to stop
when you win money.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.624
Why do you keep telling us to leave?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.046
You ran out of cash.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.173
Is that it?

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.762
There's no cash?

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:21.973
What's going on?

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.271
If you have eyes, take a good look.

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:34.194
Here, we always have at least
three billion won in cash ready.

00:11:35.946 --> 00:11:38.323
Why did you have to say that?

00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:41.868
I'm really sorry about that.

00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:46.248
Okay. I'll play one last round.

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.167
All in.

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.382
Ma'am, if you raise the bet--

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.176
Is it time for the young and rich boss
to step forward?

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.929
It's the last round.
You all right with that?

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.652
In that case,
we'll be switching the dealer.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.761
Shoot.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:53.356
Now, let me roll the juryeonggu.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.583
White or red.

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:15.045
Between the moon and the sun,

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:18.423
what would you choose?

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.971
-Red?
-Red? No.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.610
Red... Red.

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:39.694
Red.

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.404
-Red it is.
-Red.

00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:42.739
Red.

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:47.035
Then I'll go with white.

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:58.880
Shall we check now?

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:04.803
Let's see who the goddess
of victory smiles upon.

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:23.947
Red.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.031
It's red.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.663
No way.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:34.833
It's two billion.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.380
This doesn't count.

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.591
This doesn't count! It's my money.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:43.550
Let this go.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.760
There's no way I'd make a mistake.

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.053
This doesn't count.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.471
You're a scammer.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:51.891
You said it was a 50-50 chance.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:52.976
Let go!

00:14:58.148 --> 00:15:00.442
Let this go, you prick!

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.735
You let go!

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:09.701
Two billion...

00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.499
Leave the money behind.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.709
Then I won't kill you.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.512
You think it's that easy to kill someone?

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:11.429
What?

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.391
You think I can't?

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:16.976
All right.

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:19.688
Kill me if you can.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.109
I dare you.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:32.325
The cops are here!

00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:35.036
It's the police! Run!

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:39.249
The police are here! Run!

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:44.295
Freeze!

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:47.424
Oh, long time no see, Kim Mi-yeong.

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:49.801
Why are you holding a sword?
That's dangerous.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:54.347
Are you performing shows
at the casino now?

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.808
You must be so busy.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.565
Oh, is this about that bag?

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.191
Bring it here.

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:07.152
What? Oh, the bag.

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:10.447
Hurry. Give it to him.

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.325
That's mine. Don't touch it.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:15.702
Kim Mi-yeong.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:19.330
You're under arrest for operating
an illegal gambling den

00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:22.417
and the attempted murder of Park Tae-chun.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.836
Put the sword down.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.589
I'm spending my money in my establishment.

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:29.883
How's that illegal or attempted murder?
Are you crazy?

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.137
And the rest of you.
None of you can get out of here.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.347
You all came here to gamble,

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.141
so don't act like you're innocent.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.226
No one's getting out of here. No one!

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.103
She's lost it.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.021
Take her!

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:43.938
No.

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.318
-Drop the sword.
-No one's leaving.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.905
Where do you think you're going?

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.082
Deok-pil.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.335
Baek-hwa, run.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.170
-Deok-pil, are you okay?
-Run for your life.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:08.505
Come with me.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:11.925
Don't worry about me. Be happy.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:15.011
Run! I said go!

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:16.721
Now!

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:21.059
Goodbye, my love!

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.200
Seriously. I thought I was going to die.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.369
That dreadful wench.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:43.081
Goodbye, my love!

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:47.877
That shameless kid basically
threw himself at me.

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.715
Well, I guess it's my fault.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.887
If it's a crime to be this attractive,
then I guess I'm guilty.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:18.825
Cut.

00:19:23.746 --> 00:19:25.957
Are you going to lie there all day?

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:31.921
Dang, this disguise is just overkill.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:34.424
Ouch. I'm too busy for this.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.303
It stings.

00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:58.865
This one was so much fun.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.284
Stop laughing.

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.454
Hey, "my love"? Seriously?

00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:12.962
Goodbye, my love!

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:15.715
Hey, that was in the script.

00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:17.759
I almost got up because of you.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:19.594
I only sticked to the script.

00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.180
-Seriously.
-It was hilarious.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:24.432
Be quiet.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.684
Everyone, good work.

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.353
Good work.

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:32.106
Well done.

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:35.318
My money.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:42.867
Two billion won...

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:51.000
What is all this?

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:53.962
What is this...

00:20:54.045 --> 00:20:57.340
My two billion.

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:13.272
Kim Deok-pil, you son of a bitch!

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.738
My two billion!

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.203
CASINO OWNER HWA-RAN
STARRING YUN YI-RANG

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:32.417
DETECTIVE CHOI, DEALER GWIYISU
STARRING JAMES

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:37.213
KIM DEOK-PIL, AKA MR. KIM
STARRING MYUNG GU-HO

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.223
I can't believe you did that.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.683
Change the dealer?

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.643
James, does that make sense to you?

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:53.312
What's the fun if we only stick
to the script?

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:55.231
The best part of a scam is the improv.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.109
I'm all for improv,
but you need to dial it back.

00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:00.778
You coming in like that
totally threw me off.

00:22:00.862 --> 00:22:01.738
That's what I mean.

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.323
Still, that look on your face
wasn't so bad.

00:22:05.116 --> 00:22:07.618
What happened there?
Did you really fall for me?

00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:10.705
I didn't fall for you. No.

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:13.207
-No...
-Never mind then.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.960
I'm hungry. How about some lobster?

00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:16.878
Sounds good to me.

00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:44.739
It's full-bodied,

00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:49.202
has a delicate nose,
and there's even a subtle wisp of smoke.

00:22:49.285 --> 00:22:52.705
Montrachet is the best white wine.

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.791
Montrachet goes down smoothly.

00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:56.417
So? Is it France this time?

00:22:57.335 --> 00:23:02.507
I went shopping in Paris last week,
and I bought a winery there.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.593
Of course you'd go global
with your investments.

00:23:07.261 --> 00:23:09.222
So how's the laundering cost this time?

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:10.389
Not bad.

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:13.101
We saved the production cost
thanks to Mr. Mustache's connection,

00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:14.560
because he used to be on a film crew.

00:23:15.228 --> 00:23:17.105
I love it. Amazing.

00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:20.024
Why don't we take a trip to celebrate?

00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:21.984
Sounds good to me. Just the three of us.

00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:24.654
How about sky diving in Waikiki?

00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.198
How'd you know? That's on my bucket list.

00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:30.952
That was on your bucket list?

00:23:31.035 --> 00:23:33.663
It's surfing in Waikiki,
but if I can skydive,

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:34.747
that's one shot two kills.

00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:36.457
I love it.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.587
Gu-ho, you're coming, right?

00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:44.674
I'll sit that one out.

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:47.051
-What's the fun without you?
-Why?

00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:51.055
I just don't think this line of work
really suits me.

00:23:51.139 --> 00:23:52.056
I'm out.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.432
My goodness.

00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:54.600
What are you talking about?

00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:55.852
I can't do it anymore.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.522
Gu-ho, have you forgotten
about our promise?

00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:01.649
Oh, the ten billion?

00:24:02.066 --> 00:24:03.693
We cleaned that out two jobs ago.

00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:05.361
-Did we?
-Yes.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.074
What about you do this next job
out of loyalty?

00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:13.286
I've got some really dirty laundry
to deal with.

00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:14.912
So I need you.

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:16.998
Please? What do you say?

00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.334
Please, will you?

00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:25.006
-Please?
-I'm off. Bye for real.

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:27.466
Don't try to reach me. Goodbye.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.718
Are you leaving?

00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:31.470
Are you leaving? What about your share?

00:24:34.265 --> 00:24:35.474
Donate the rest.

00:24:35.558 --> 00:24:37.351
Really? Jackpot.

00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:38.436
-Split it?
-Split it?

00:24:40.563 --> 00:24:41.397
"Split it"?

00:24:42.607 --> 00:24:44.108
Can't you say goodbye

00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:47.904
or take care like normal people?

00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:49.864
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:51.157
Forget it.

00:24:53.868 --> 00:24:55.870
I'll bet my arm that he'll come back.

00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:57.914
-I'll bet my foot on it.
-Oh, yes.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.507
1 MONTH LATER

00:25:32.073 --> 00:25:36.118
Hey. That hurts.

00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:37.286
CHEONMYEONG SHOP

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.622
-What's taking you so long?
-You came just in time.

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:41.165
-Ma'am.
-I packed you side dishes.

00:25:41.249 --> 00:25:44.126
I feel bad every time.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.213
I packed it while I packed some for Bo-ra.
Don't feel bad.

00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:50.508
-Thank you so much.
-One cone, three popsicles.

00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:54.136
You little brats.
Do you think he's your wallet?

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.097
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.350
Still, they try to be thoughtful
and avoid picking anything expensive.

00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:01.978
Hurry up. Let's play soccer.

00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.105
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

00:26:04.522 --> 00:26:05.523
Wait for me!

00:26:06.107 --> 00:26:07.775
Hey. Pass.

00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:08.693
Wait.

00:26:09.318 --> 00:26:11.195
You need to pass better.

00:26:11.696 --> 00:26:13.656
Go grab it.

00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:16.200
Can you throw the ball?

00:26:17.285 --> 00:26:18.452
Gosh.

00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:20.746
-The ice cream...
-Look.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.206
-What?
-What is it?

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.332
Over there.

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:24.250
What is it?

00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:36.512
Cool.

00:26:43.686 --> 00:26:44.520
What?

00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:03.372
-What…
-What's that?

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:06.167
-This is weird.
-Guys, stay here.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.044
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:11.005
It's stuffy in here.

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.509
Are you okay?

00:27:17.428 --> 00:27:19.221
-What's happening?
-Excuse me?

00:27:22.016 --> 00:27:22.933
Hey!

00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:27.605
I missed you.

00:27:34.945 --> 00:27:37.406
-Gosh. Yi-rang.
-I missed you.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.575
What are you doing here?

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:42.536
Seriously!

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.624
Yi-rang, what are you doing here?

00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:48.584
Gosh, seriously!

00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:06.769
Yi-rang, the moment you enter my life,
you ruin the peace.

00:28:06.852 --> 00:28:08.979
-Just like today.
-How about this interpretation?

00:28:09.313 --> 00:28:14.652
A very quiet independent movie met me

00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:18.781
and becomes
a wild, spectacular mega hit movie.

00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:21.117
You know, just like the day we first met.

00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:44.932
Look. A shooting star.

00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:49.353
Hey, how many shooting stars
do you see a day?

00:28:49.437 --> 00:28:53.774
If the weather is nice,
you can see 12 easily.

00:28:53.858 --> 00:28:55.192
-Twelve?
-Yes.

00:28:57.319 --> 00:29:01.365
That means 12 of my wishes
will come true in a day.

00:29:02.324 --> 00:29:04.118
I like it here.

00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:07.830
Here.

00:29:09.582 --> 00:29:11.375
Bon appétit!

00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:14.003
I caught them today.

00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:16.380
They're fresh wild abalones.

00:29:16.464 --> 00:29:19.258
So it should be fancy enough
even for your refined palate.

00:29:22.303 --> 00:29:25.681
It's not just fancy. This is magnificent.

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:29.560
The texture... So yummy.

00:29:35.733 --> 00:29:36.734
It's annoying.

00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:39.987
Why? What is?

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:44.992
I mean, I expected you
to be miserable and struggling.

00:29:45.075 --> 00:29:48.871
But with fresh food and fresh air,
you were doing better without me.

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:49.914
Was it fun?

00:29:53.042 --> 00:29:54.418
You were worried about me.

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:57.755
You know I never worry about anything.

00:29:58.672 --> 00:30:02.259
I guess those emotions are too much to ask
from someone who was born a sociopath.

00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:04.970
Gu-ho.

00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:09.099
I'm not a sociopath.

00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:15.189
I'm sorry. I was joking.
Don't be so serious.

00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:19.652
I'm a genius sociopath.

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:22.571
So call me a geniopath. I'm a geniopath.

00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:26.033
Right. I almost forgot I never stood
a chance against a geniopath.

00:30:26.116 --> 00:30:27.535
Just eat this.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:29.578
-Gosh.
-Good.

00:30:30.746 --> 00:30:32.164
This one's perfectly cooked.

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.917
JAMES

00:30:36.293 --> 00:30:37.586
Why is he calling me at this hour?

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:41.757
Hello?

00:30:47.137 --> 00:30:47.972
What?

00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:50.432
What is it? What's he saying?

00:31:01.902 --> 00:31:03.070
It's all your fault.

00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:05.322
What?

00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:09.952
What happened, Yi-rang?

00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:12.413
Our plan was perfect.

00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:15.207
What plan?

00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:17.626
How did this happen to James?

00:31:18.294 --> 00:31:19.128
Tell me.

00:31:19.587 --> 00:31:21.672
Say something, Yi-rang.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.428
Jeon Tae-su.

00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:30.222
Jeon Tae-su?

00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:33.058
The chairman of the Sand Foundation,
a public trust.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.938
Ready, set, go.

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.483
SAND HAVEN SPORTS DAY

00:31:41.775 --> 00:31:43.777
Be careful not to run into each other.

00:31:44.987 --> 00:31:49.074
One, two, one, two.

00:31:49.158 --> 00:31:52.745
On the outside,
he looks like an honest business man

00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:59.043
who donates and runs an orphanage
with the money he made.

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.045
Bye, kids. See you!

00:32:01.462 --> 00:32:03.213
-No!
-No!

00:32:03.297 --> 00:32:05.341
-Don't go!
-I'll see you again.

00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:09.261
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:32:10.888 --> 00:32:13.599
But that's completely fabricated.

00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:16.310
Well done, sir.

00:32:18.729 --> 00:32:21.315
-Tell them to bathe the kids.
-Yes, sir.

00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:23.233
Gosh.

00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:37.998
Do you know what the most important thing
is in a relationship?

00:32:38.916 --> 00:32:42.544
Trust, obviously. It'd be trust, sir. Yes.

00:32:43.379 --> 00:32:47.091
You say that,
yet you miss the interest due date?

00:32:48.342 --> 00:32:51.178
That's not it.

00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:53.097
There's someone who refuses to vacate.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.808
So we ran into a snag
with the land acquisition.

00:32:56.767 --> 00:32:59.520
And because of that,
the construction got delayed.

00:33:00.646 --> 00:33:02.231
And I couldn't retrieve the money.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.530
Please help me, sir.
This is too much for me to handle.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.867
How long has it been
since we've known each other?

00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:16.245
It's been 20 years this year.

00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:23.419
Sir.

00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:26.046
Please.

00:33:28.757 --> 00:33:33.011
We've spent enough time
for mountains and rivers to change twice.

00:33:35.097 --> 00:33:37.558
You and I are basically family.

00:33:37.975 --> 00:33:40.269
Yes, sir.

00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:42.396
For sure, sir.

00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:44.898
We should help each other
when things get tough.

00:33:46.734 --> 00:33:47.693
We're family.

00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:50.320
Right, family.

00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:59.037
Let me settle it smoothly.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.039
Thank you, sir.

00:34:01.123 --> 00:34:01.999
Thank you!

00:34:02.416 --> 00:34:04.376
Thank you so much.

00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:08.881
RESTRICTED AREA
EXPECTED TO BE DEMOLISHED

00:34:16.096 --> 00:34:17.598
NAZARETH CATHOLIC CHURCH

00:34:17.681 --> 00:34:19.600
Hey. We're going in.

00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:25.773
We're having seaweed soup today.

00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:30.652
I just need to bring meat and rice.

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:33.822
Min-su, you're late.

00:34:43.123 --> 00:34:44.124
Who are you?

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.461
Where do you want me to sit, Sister?

00:34:51.006 --> 00:34:52.633
Gosh.

00:34:56.136 --> 00:34:57.679
How can you be eating right now?

00:34:58.806 --> 00:35:01.350
When someone's about to be buried in debt?

00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:03.435
I'm not saying I won't leave.

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:05.229
I told you I need to find a place first--

00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:06.480
Exactly.

00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:09.942
Because of you,
we're about to end up on the street!

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.153
What are you doing?

00:35:13.237 --> 00:35:14.363
Tear it apart.

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.114
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:35:17.407 --> 00:35:18.700
What are you doing?

00:35:27.251 --> 00:35:28.502
Please stop.

00:35:28.585 --> 00:35:29.753
Please!

00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:36.552
Stop it.

00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:37.761
Seriously.

00:35:37.845 --> 00:35:38.887
Sister!

00:35:41.348 --> 00:35:42.808
Min-su!

00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:45.978
-Min-su.
-Get out of my way!

00:35:47.062 --> 00:35:48.063
No.

00:35:59.575 --> 00:36:03.579
INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER YOUTH
ASSAULTING CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYEE

00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:05.163
VICTIM HOSPITALIZED FOR 4 WEEKS

00:36:05.247 --> 00:36:06.373
RELIGIOUS GROUP REMAINS SILENT

00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:08.834
A NEW NAIL HOUSE EXPLOITING YOUTH?

00:36:08.917 --> 00:36:11.670
Thanks to you, I was able to start
the construction on time.

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:14.131
It's all thanks to you.

00:36:16.383 --> 00:36:18.468
I will serve you with all my heart.

00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.931
But in reality,
he's a living legend among loan sharks.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:27.728
A mere loan shark who used to lend money
to merchants and pick on gambling houses

00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:30.480
became the biggest gang in Gangnam.

00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:32.900
Let's start with Gwangju today.

00:36:32.983 --> 00:36:35.986
He's called the dark godfather.

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:39.531
It's not enough.

00:36:39.615 --> 00:36:41.408
He's the godfather
of the underground economy.

00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:46.872
His so-called family is built on trust,
with him at the very top.

00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:49.666
It's almost like a cult.

00:36:50.584 --> 00:36:52.628
They also have strong solidarity.

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:56.298
One moment, they'd share
like real blood brothers, but then…

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:08.977
Sir.

00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:33.210
Once one betrays, it's over.

00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:34.753
Your life's done for.

00:37:34.836 --> 00:37:37.214
SAND FOUNDATION
SINCE 1998

00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:49.351
He got the tip-off that Sand Foundation's
tax evasion is being investigated.

00:37:50.477 --> 00:37:53.563
The National Tax Service is conducting
a special investigation,

00:37:53.647 --> 00:37:55.357
and no one knows when they will strike.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.359
But I'm pretty sure it's tormenting him.

00:37:58.568 --> 00:38:03.240
The public trust is only a shield
to hide his slush fund.

00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:09.955
Rumor has it that he hid tens of billions
from the National Tax Service.

00:38:11.707 --> 00:38:17.421
He hid it so well
that no one knows where that money is.

00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:24.553
Anyway, now that
the investigators are closing in,

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.264
what Jeon Tae-su needs is

00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:30.767
to take off to another country
with as much cash as he can.

00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:42.738
KIM HAN-SU

00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:46.241
And James approached him
at the perfect time.

00:38:47.117 --> 00:38:48.952
I'm not worried about the cash,

00:38:49.036 --> 00:38:52.205
but without my ID and license,
I won't be able to set sail.

00:38:52.289 --> 00:38:54.124
I'll look into it right away.

00:38:54.207 --> 00:38:55.333
Thank you.

00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:57.919
Is this yours?

00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:04.134
Yes. Thank you.

00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.845
I don't know how to repay you.

00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:08.305
No, it's okay.

00:39:08.388 --> 00:39:09.598
-Bye now.
-One second.

00:39:12.559 --> 00:39:15.020
I'll contact you
as soon as I return from Singapore.

00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:16.229
CAPTAIN KIM HAN-SU

00:39:22.778 --> 00:39:24.071
How was your trip to Singapore?

00:39:24.154 --> 00:39:26.990
Thanks to you, I had a good trip.

00:39:27.657 --> 00:39:28.742
Cheers.

00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:34.790
What do you think?

00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.917
It's huge.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:39.044
Thank you.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.853
I think I was lucky to meet you.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.399
We were waiting for him to bite the bait.

00:40:02.067 --> 00:40:04.611
Then Jeon Tae-su suddenly
reached out to us.

00:40:08.031 --> 00:40:11.451
Captain, may I ask you for a big favor?

00:40:11.785 --> 00:40:14.663
What's there to hesitate between us?

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:16.289
What can be so big?

00:40:16.373 --> 00:40:17.332
Tell me anything.

00:40:18.542 --> 00:40:19.376
Excuse me.

00:40:20.502 --> 00:40:25.006
Actually there's something
I want to send abroad from Seoul.

00:40:26.383 --> 00:40:31.012
When James couldn't reach me,
he proceeded alone.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.893
-We're from the Customs Office!
-Who are you?

00:40:36.977 --> 00:40:38.770
Get out of the way. We're on duty.

00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:39.688
Make way.

00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:42.190
-Get out.
-Get out of the way.

00:40:42.274 --> 00:40:43.108
Open it.

00:40:46.695 --> 00:40:49.239
-What the?
-There's nothing.

00:40:54.077 --> 00:40:56.204
Are you saying Jeon Tae-su caught on?

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:15.307
Yes.

00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:18.518
Jeon Tae-su did this to James.

00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:21.354
PATIENT: JAMES
DIAGNOSIS: MULTIPLE FRACTURES

00:41:21.438 --> 00:41:22.314
I should've been there.

00:41:22.397 --> 00:41:25.775
What should I do if James doesn't wake up?

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.195
I'll do it.

00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:30.197
Do what?

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.616
I'll take revenge for James.

00:41:33.533 --> 00:41:34.868
No. That's too dangerous.

00:41:34.951 --> 00:41:37.037
Then are you going to let him
get away with this?

00:41:41.291 --> 00:41:42.417
Jeon Tae-su.

00:41:43.752 --> 00:41:47.589
I'm going to take every penny he's got.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:54.012
If that's his hell, I'll give him hell.

00:41:57.474 --> 00:41:59.809
I'm just as angry as you are,
but this is too dangerous.

00:41:59.893 --> 00:42:01.895
James is my family.

00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:05.732
Isn't he yours?

00:42:08.318 --> 00:42:11.655
-James, I suddenly got a question.
-Yes?

00:42:11.738 --> 00:42:15.700
Who's saved as number one in your phone?

00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:18.828
-All of a sudden?
-I'm suddenly curious.

00:42:18.912 --> 00:42:20.330
Of course, it's you.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.501
What are you talking about?

00:42:27.462 --> 00:42:29.297
GU-HO

00:42:29.381 --> 00:42:31.174
You're always my number one.

00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:33.885
What?

00:42:36.638 --> 00:42:38.223
Anyway, why is Yi-rang taking so long?

00:42:38.932 --> 00:42:39.933
YI-RANG

00:42:41.226 --> 00:42:43.270
I was always his number one.

00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:46.481
What? You were his number one?

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.652
You're right. You got the call earlier
letting us know about his state.

00:42:52.237 --> 00:42:53.113
What?

00:42:54.864 --> 00:42:56.700
Then what's my number?

00:42:57.367 --> 00:42:58.201
James.

00:42:58.785 --> 00:43:00.870
-What's my number?
-That's not the point.

00:43:00.954 --> 00:43:01.913
Stop it.

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:05.125
-Yi-rang.
-Where's his phone?

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.725
Gu-ho. Look.

00:43:21.808 --> 00:43:23.310
-What?
-What do you think?

00:43:23.393 --> 00:43:27.439
Like Meonggae that died
holding the enemy's general.

00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:31.109
I'll sacrifice myself to take his revenge.

00:43:31.735 --> 00:43:33.737
-Hey.
-How do I look?

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.697
-No. Wait right there.
-What?

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.656
-Wait right there.
-Why?

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.117
-What?
-Put that away.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.786
Besides, it's Nongae, not Meonggae.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.664
Never. Please don't do that.

00:43:44.748 --> 00:43:47.250
Why not? Oh, is it too sexy?

00:43:48.585 --> 00:43:49.753
I knew

00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:52.547
you were the only one who cares about me.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.590
Me?

00:43:53.673 --> 00:43:54.507
Yes.

00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:55.425
-No?
-No.

00:43:55.508 --> 00:43:58.094
-I said you shouldn't because you can't.
-I can't?

00:43:58.178 --> 00:44:00.180
Yi-rang, to be honest,

00:44:00.263 --> 00:44:02.265
you don't have what it takes to do that.

00:44:03.892 --> 00:44:06.519
What are you talking about?
When I have my fortune read,

00:44:06.603 --> 00:44:09.773
they say I'm all about
being artistic and attractive.

00:44:09.856 --> 00:44:11.524
My beauty is my biggest weapon.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.908
Let's be honest.
Have you ever succeeded before?

00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:22.118
What should I say about your badger game?

00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:25.789
You're way too enthusiastic. It's scary.

00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:28.958
You make a man's desire for romance
shrivel up and disappear.

00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:31.669
Do you remember the laundry guy before?

00:44:31.753 --> 00:44:34.089
He turned himself in
just to get away from you.

00:44:34.172 --> 00:44:36.174
So we didn't get any money

00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:37.842
and ended up spending
so much for the cost.

00:44:37.926 --> 00:44:39.761
-And--
-Enough. Stop it.

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:43.598
I'll find another way.

00:44:45.975 --> 00:44:49.604
How could you say something so mean?

00:44:50.605 --> 00:44:51.439
You can do it.

00:44:51.523 --> 00:44:52.649
-Get lost.
-Get lost.

00:44:53.775 --> 00:44:54.692
You can do it.

00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:56.945
Jerk.

00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:26.558
Have you given up on the plan?

00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:28.226
I already have it ready.

00:45:28.685 --> 00:45:29.769
But you were slacking off.

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:34.065
You get creative ideas when you slack off.

00:45:35.817 --> 00:45:37.360
So what's your plan?

00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:45.034
The place no one can get out,
even the president.

00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:48.329
We already failed with the ship.

00:45:48.413 --> 00:45:49.247
So now,

00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.167
over there.

00:45:54.252 --> 00:45:55.253
The sky.

00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:10.810
Yes!

00:46:10.894 --> 00:46:13.980
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for flying...

00:46:43.551 --> 00:46:45.094
Here's some fruit.

00:46:45.178 --> 00:46:47.514
Do you need anything else?
How about some wine?

00:46:48.014 --> 00:46:50.350
-I'm good.
-Okay.

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:52.852
SAND FOUNDATION HOLDS EVENT
AT THE CHILD WELFARE FACILITY

00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:57.273
-Here.
-Do you need anything?

00:46:58.816 --> 00:47:01.569
If you had used that brain better,
you'd be successful now.

00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:03.863
That'd be a waste of talent.

00:47:16.209 --> 00:47:18.461
-Oh, it's cold!
-What the? Are you kidding me?

00:47:18.545 --> 00:47:19.420
It's so cold.

00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:22.090
Don't you know
that I only drink Canadian water

00:47:22.173 --> 00:47:24.175
from the North Atlantic glacier?

00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:27.762
-Sorry. The flight schedule was mixed up.
-The flight schedule?

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:32.141
What's more important between your crappy
flight schedule or my high-end taste?

00:47:33.017 --> 00:47:35.603
Did Director Choi hire you? I can tell.

00:47:35.687 --> 00:47:37.230
Do you want me to fire you both?

00:47:37.647 --> 00:47:39.274
Why involve him when it's my fault?

00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:42.694
How dare you talk back to me?
I could just...

00:47:42.777 --> 00:47:45.196
Keep it down. It's not like
you rented this plane.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.948
Rent?

00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:50.285
Only poor people would rent planes.
This whole plane is mine.

00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:53.288
-Do you want to get out?
-This will only cause trouble.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:56.332
-If you could please calm down...
-Don't touch me.

00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:58.543
These pathetic losers.

00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:00.962
Now go get me the water already!

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:04.424
Made from Canadian glacier ice.

00:48:04.507 --> 00:48:05.550
I'm sorry.

00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:07.719
-My apologies.
-It has to be from Canada.

00:48:33.995 --> 00:48:36.748
-Watch out, man.
-You little...

00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:38.374
My apologies.

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:42.837
Gosh. You can't even carry the bag?

00:48:48.384 --> 00:48:50.762
Seriously? This is so ridiculous.

00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:54.724
You're driving me crazy.

00:48:54.807 --> 00:48:56.934
What are you doing?

00:48:57.018 --> 00:48:58.102
This isn't my bag!

00:48:58.186 --> 00:49:01.314
Seriously. This is ridiculous.

00:49:01.397 --> 00:49:04.651
Why do you always have to drive me crazy?

00:49:15.453 --> 00:49:16.913
Where's the car?

00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:30.468
-I swear I didn't even touch it.
-What?

00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:35.390
I didn't know it was your money... Sir.

00:49:35.473 --> 00:49:37.433
Please I'm begging you.

00:49:37.517 --> 00:49:40.687
I'll work like a dog from now on. Sir.

00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:46.901
You still don't know your place.

00:49:48.403 --> 00:49:52.740
You've always been a dog.
You were never anything more than that.

00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:07.797
You'll still have to pay for the interest
before you die.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.341
Open him up to see what we can sell
and dump his body in the ocean.

00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:11.634
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:50:11.718 --> 00:50:14.595
Sir. Please give me one more chance.

00:50:21.436 --> 00:50:22.979
That son of a bitch.

00:50:25.982 --> 00:50:26.983
What's this?

00:50:33.072 --> 00:50:36.367
Seriously, you're unbelievable.

00:50:36.451 --> 00:50:38.327
This isn't my bag!

00:50:38.411 --> 00:50:39.996
What are you going to do about my money?

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.712
What a coincidence.

00:51:19.786 --> 00:51:23.539
Should you really be this relaxed,
Ms. Flight Attendant?

00:51:23.623 --> 00:51:27.043
Oh, my. What brings you here?

00:51:27.126 --> 00:51:29.045
You're more relaxed than expected.

00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:31.881
I asked around to find you
because I was worried.

00:51:31.964 --> 00:51:34.091
Oh, that man?

00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:39.138
He's probably drunk by now.

00:51:47.313 --> 00:51:50.691
Oh, my. Thank you so much.

00:51:50.775 --> 00:51:53.945
I didn't know what to do
because I didn't even have your number.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.824
Consider yourself lucky.

00:51:58.533 --> 00:51:59.784
Oh, yes.

00:52:04.205 --> 00:52:06.916
You know how to drink.

00:52:14.173 --> 00:52:16.467
Why is life so tough?

00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:19.595
You saw how that prick treated me, right?

00:52:19.679 --> 00:52:21.806
He shouldn't do that
to someone's precious daughter.

00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:24.433
Right? That's what I mean.

00:52:24.517 --> 00:52:26.978
He's not the owner. It's his dad.

00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:31.983
Only poor people would rent planes.
This whole plane is mine.

00:52:32.692 --> 00:52:35.945
He's nothing more than a love child.

00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:40.700
Oh, my goodness. What am I saying?

00:52:40.783 --> 00:52:42.952
I'm sorry.

00:52:43.035 --> 00:52:46.664
-I forgot what I just said.
-What?

00:52:47.039 --> 00:52:48.457
I don't remember either.

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:52.003
Oh, my gosh. You're so witty.

00:52:55.673 --> 00:53:00.595
-That cute young master--
-No, he's a horrible son of a bitch.

00:53:12.481 --> 00:53:16.235
Do you want to go somewhere else?

00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:20.114
-Round two?
-Round two.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.074
Sounds good to me.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:23.784
For round two.

00:54:04.033 --> 00:54:08.371
Hi. My young master bastard.

00:54:26.764 --> 00:54:28.474
Hey, film this.

00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:32.728
Our young master.

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:35.982
Are you happy?

00:54:40.236 --> 00:54:45.324
One's high, and the other's drunk.

00:54:45.908 --> 00:54:47.868
What a fantastic couple.

00:54:47.952 --> 00:54:49.787
-You are stupid.
-Yeah?

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.455
-You want to die?
-Die?

00:54:52.832 --> 00:54:55.918
Wake up, young master.

00:54:56.002 --> 00:54:58.838
-Hey.
-Hey. Let go.

00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:07.680
Who the hell are you? Huh?

00:55:07.763 --> 00:55:11.767
Hey. Put the bottle down
and fight like a man. You cheap jerk.

00:55:13.102 --> 00:55:15.187
Fine.

00:55:15.563 --> 00:55:19.775
Hey. I was a boxer. Bring it on.

00:55:19.859 --> 00:55:21.402
Bring it on.

00:55:26.949 --> 00:55:28.534
Happy?

00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:46.552
I don't care whether you spend this money
on gambling or on drugs.

00:55:47.178 --> 00:55:48.387
What I care about is

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.767
how you brought this money
into this country without any trouble.

00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:56.562
This is my first time.
You have to trust me.

00:55:56.645 --> 00:55:58.689
Are you trying
to slip out of this by yourself?

00:55:58.773 --> 00:56:00.608
I'm doing this because I'm a newbie.

00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:01.734
-I never--
-Sir.

00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:03.736
I need you to take a look at this.

00:56:03.819 --> 00:56:07.364
Here's the video
of Rising Airlines' love child.

00:56:09.075 --> 00:56:11.118
Me? What about me? What?

00:56:12.828 --> 00:56:15.206
RISING AIRLINES' LOVE CHILD

00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:23.130
Check his left shoulder.

00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:35.768
A gun?

00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:51.492
Who are you?

00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:15.641
YE-SOL'S

00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:26.152
SAKWANG REAL ESTATE

00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:29.155
Hello.

00:57:31.073 --> 00:57:34.201
I put the restaurant on the market.

00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:42.960
Jeong Ye-sol.

00:57:46.672 --> 00:57:48.132
How do you know my name?

00:57:48.215 --> 00:57:50.176
Who doesn't know about you
in this neighborhood?

00:57:51.218 --> 00:57:53.304
Here. This is for your mom.

00:57:54.263 --> 00:57:59.310
And if you keep faking your cough,
you'll get sick for real.

00:58:00.978 --> 00:58:04.023
You've done well in the past,
and you continue to do quite well.

00:58:04.523 --> 00:58:06.442
So trust yourself.

00:58:06.525 --> 00:58:08.944
Don't let your mom visit fortune tellers.

00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:12.156
I'm sorry.

00:58:13.908 --> 00:58:16.744
No need to apologize to me. Bye.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.210
What is all this?

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:29.381
Let's just...

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.260
call it the laundry bill.

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.167
This much evidence could lead
to a search warrant within a month.

00:59:05.876 --> 00:59:07.503
I need to push the timeline forward.

00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:10.631
What do you want me to do about the two?
Should I keep digging?

00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:13.842
No one outside of these four walls
must know about our meeting.

00:59:13.926 --> 00:59:15.052
That's how people are.

00:59:15.135 --> 00:59:18.097
They only believe
what they can see with their own eyes.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.934
Stop spinning that worthless brain
of yours and find a way.

00:59:22.017 --> 00:59:23.936
That's why I kept you alive.

00:59:24.019 --> 00:59:27.106
We can fool the X-ray by placing
a shielding device in our luggage.

00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:31.652
It's all a set-up.

00:59:31.735 --> 00:59:33.404
You were born to do this.

00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:36.282
It'd be a shame
to let this talent go to waste.

00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:37.825
What a shame.

00:59:39.118 --> 00:59:40.577
-What?
-It was almost perfect.

00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:43.664
You know what happens
when you fail to carry out his order?

00:59:43.747 --> 00:59:45.374
I beg you.

00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:47.835
We should enjoy the ending
of our project together.
