00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.920
Mr. Na!

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.300
Why are you taking the bus today?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.280
None of your business.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.420
Don't wander around and go home.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.130
Got it?

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.770
We have to go to cram school anyway.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.380
By the way, are you going somewhere nice?

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.060
Huh?

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.840
You've been smiling a lot lately.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.480
I've never seen you this happy before.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.440
We'll get going, Mr. Na.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.390
Yes, I'm happy.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.030
Siyeol,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.500
if I

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.490
tell you that I've liked you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.690
since a long, long time ago,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.850
how would you react?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.820
Honestly, I'm more objective

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.660
because I'm not a fan.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.200
His ankle injury was also

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.220
just a fake excuse to stop the backlash,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.390
wasn't it?

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.770
A fake excuse to stop the backlash?

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.960
Sorry, due to time constraintsâ€”

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.030
So, are you saying

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.410
you'd risk your life
to cover up something like that?

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.110
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.400
This is the first time
I'm mentioning this to the public.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.770
Yeon Jooha's leg injury...

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.340
was because of me.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.500
At the time of the incident,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.710
it was only revealed that

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.860
Yeon Jooha, a debut-group trainee,
injured his leg.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.600
Since he wasn't famous back then,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.520
news reports were all
based on our agency's statement.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.840
So, please don't ever
make such careless judgements again.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.090
If anyone tries to slander Yeon Jooha,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.860
I'll take corresponding measures

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.410
to rectify the situation.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.380
Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.640
Seriously... So melodramatic.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.220
If I tell you that
I still like you a lot...

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.750
This is what you're concerned with, huh?

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.000
Hey, Choi Siyeol!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.760
I've been meaning to ask you this.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.700
Do you like Yeon Jooha?

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.010
I wonder if you'll feel the same way

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.010
as I do.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.360
Yes.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.550
What about Na Aejoon?

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.960
Why are you dating him?

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.380
You knew your boyfriend was
dating someone else, but you...

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.510
you were just condoning it?

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.670
Boyfriend?

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.480
So, are you saying...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.550
you hit on Na Aejoon because you think

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.390
he and I are dating?

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.400
Yeah.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.970
Are you insane?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.910
Na Aejoon.

Was it your plan all along?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.890
Answer me, Choi Siyeol.

You're the one who needs to
commit to one person.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.770
Na Aejoon has been...

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.440
feeling guilty about
not telling you that we're relatives,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.610
but you...

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.590
Forget it.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.660
I'll eat later.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.770
Don't worry.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.650
I'm going out now.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.110
Call me if anything happens.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.970
Okay.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.480
If you're struggling...

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.430
I'm okay.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.500
It'll pass with time.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.460
Alright.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.390
See you at night.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.660
What have I been doing

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.510
all this time?

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.470
I want Mr. Na Aejoon to guide me.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.040
M-M-Me?

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.750

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.980
You don't want to?

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.270
Mr. Na Aejoon

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.440
is my ideal type.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.630
I should've known that something was off.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.750
Can't you... like me?

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.940
He was unusually interested in me
from the first time we met.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.750
I hope our first kiss

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.260

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.890
in your memory.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.720
Was

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.950
anything between us real at all?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.430
What should I do now?

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.800
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.820
Good job today.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.450

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.429
Aren't you off work too?
Going to the office?

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.039
I heard Siyeol is nearby.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.429
I'm going to give him the concept plan.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:37.720
I see.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.799
How's the public reception?

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.539
Did it cause any trouble?

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.080
The reception is
more positive than we expected.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.550
But after the talk with Mr. Ji,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.960
Siyeol's been looking quite listless.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.840
Where is he? I'll go with you.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.550
Sure, let's go.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.550
Jooha?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.940
What brings you here?

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.960
He was shooting something nearby.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.040
Do you want some food or drinks?

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.590
No, I'm good.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.340
I'll go order our drinks
and make a call first.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.650
Okay.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.280
It's rare that you end so early.
You should go home and rest.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.610
Why did you come here?

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.060
Hyeonwoo's worried about you.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.960
About me?

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.560
He's worried that fans would blame him

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.020
for how listless and down you've been.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.740
Hah. So he's not really worried about me.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.730
What did you talk about with Ji Kyusung?

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.720
Is it because of
what you said on the radio?

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.060
I told him I like you.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.200
What?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.710
But I'm sure he already knew.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.310
I was mad that someone I like is hurt,

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:24.230
so I tried to steal the man
Kyusung was supposedly seeing.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.000
You mean...

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.040
that guy?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.390
Yes,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.790
Na Aejoon.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.320
But I was mistaken.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.310
He's not his boyfriend or anything else,

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.470
but just a relative.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.600
We'd spent quite a lot of time together,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.210
and a lot of things happened between us.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.760
I know

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.280
I was being very reckless and stupid.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.710
So, if you get the chance,
you should talk to Kyusung.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:13.420
He might have his reasons too.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.720
What about you?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.740
Huh?

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.430
Are you okay?

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.700
Jooha.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.760
Of course I'm okay.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.290
I just want you to be happy.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.210
That's always been only wish.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.240
It's true.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.210
Nothing's changed.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.640
Jooha!

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.800
Bye.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.750
He says he's okay,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.120
but he clearly seemed

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.700
very flustered that day.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.400
And what's really going on
with Ji Kyusung?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.500
Aren't you a reporter?

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.190
Hello, Jooha.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.520
What are you doing here?

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.420
Do you meet Choi Siyeol often in private?

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.320
You two seem especially close.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.500
Have you broken up with
the guy you were seeing?

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.290
I love you.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.690
How much?

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.020
I'm hungry.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.420
Sorry?

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.200
Nothing has changed.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.750
I approached him with an ulterior motive.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.960
The only person I had to protect

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.690
was Jooha.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.050
Here.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.280
A formal housewarming gift.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.040
It's a bit late,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.210
but Jooha's finally vindicated.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:13.530
Everything just came back to normal.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.690
I'll make you delicious salad
tomorrow morning then.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.740
It's true...

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.660
It's true that nothing has changed.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.850
So why?

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.450
[Hey, here's the arranged version
you mentioned.]

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.510
Your lyrics are, how should I put it...

They're rich and resonate with me.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.970
Really comforting.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.740
Thank you

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.330
for making such a great song.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.910
Why...

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.010
Why can't I...

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.010
Why can't I forget him?

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.720
[Nabit High School]

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.990
My goodness, Mr. Na.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.330
What happened to your face?

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.070
Did you cry?

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.840
No.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.960
I didn't sleep well last night,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.780
so my face is swollen.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.910
That doesn't look like it.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:11.880
Wait.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.260
You've been covering your neck
because of tonsil stones,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.650
and today you come to work
with a swollen face.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.340
Mr. Na,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.670
are you...

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.560
diabetic?

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.000
Be careful!

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.510
You need to take care of yourself
while you're still young!

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.300
It's because you always eat sweets.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.400
Diabetes is serious, you know?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.880
Oh...

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.390
Okay, thank you.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.000
Take care of yourself!

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.390
Mr. Na.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.680
You've received the schedule
for today's shoot, right?

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.780
See you in the evening.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.640
The two will enter the classroom
and make the timetable together.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.680
You have the scissors,
glue, and tape, right?

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.319
Yes.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.950
Today's focus is the bromance,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.599
so look for ways to
highlight their bromance.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.020
Okay, that's about it.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.119
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.010
Siyeol, are you ready?

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.700
Yes.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.060
Let's start then.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.880
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.470
Usually, the timetable is
updated on the app,

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.780
but we also make one
and paste it at one end of the board.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.640
Am I doing it right?

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.410
As long as you can see it clearly.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.380
Likewise, for the day's notices,

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.040
aside from app notifications,
we'll also write them on the board.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.780
On the upper right corner.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.520
We'll post competition posters

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.210
on the notice board in this hallway.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.330
Please follow me.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.260
Please don't get too close.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.120
Let me carry it.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.080
No.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.540
This isn't part of the shoot.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.380
I'll do it myself.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.040
What? All of a sudden?

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.060
What do you mean you have to drop out

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.960
of this project, Mr. Na?

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.960
I don't mean I'm dropping out right now.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.140
Until you find a replacement,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.390
I'll stay on the project.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.290
Did we do something to offend you?

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.380
Oh, no.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.510
That's not it.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:37.550
Well, since I'm not a celebrity,

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.590
it's a bit stressful to be on TV
as a teacher.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.840
Okay, I get what you mean.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.930
I'll discuss it with the staff
and get back to you.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.710
We'll pack up and leave now.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.120
Take your time.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.770
Why are you dropping out?

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.530
Because of me?

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.820
Do you hate me so much that

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.260
you can't stand being around me?

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.970
You didn't apologize to me
or try to explain yourself,

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.550
yet you want me to explain myself?

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.820
I'll do it now.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.820
Hear me outâ€”

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.740
apologies and excuses.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.580
I'm sure you already knew

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.670
that Jooha and Kyusung broke up
after a long-term relationship.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.520
Then I got the wrong idea
about Kyusung and you,

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.870
thinking you were datingâ€”

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.610
So, it's all because of Jooha.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.190
Okay.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.030
I'll accept your apology, so...

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.940
I hope we never meet
outside of the shoots again.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.090
Wait.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:42.960
Let's talk it out.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.970
Everything was fake anyway.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.530
Just a relationship for your motive.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.590
Since your motive's gone,

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.930
our relationship is naturally over.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.820
But...

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.660
I don't understand why
you're not letting me go.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.430
Are you afraid that
I'll tell people about this?

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.420
No, of course not.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.770
What else is there to talk about?

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.040
Aejoon hyung.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.040
In the time we spent together,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.370
were you sincere?

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.220
Are you seriously
talking about sincerity at this pointâ€”

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.240
I...

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.540
I was sincere.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.340
I was also confused about
why I can't let you go,

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.040
so I thought about it for a long time.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.540
I like you.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.060
I think...

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.050
I've fallen for you.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:58.580
[In the next episode]

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.840
It may not be a big deal to you,

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.870
but it is to me.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.770
Your love for me was

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.470
an obsession.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.600
But too much time has passed already.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.540
Then keep at it
until you get through to him.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.810
Oh my goodness!

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:11.640
Choi Siyeol?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.000
It's only right that

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.440
you pay for your mistakes.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.310
I don't know what I can say
to prove my sincerity to you,

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.830
but you're the one I've always loved,

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.490
not Jooha.
