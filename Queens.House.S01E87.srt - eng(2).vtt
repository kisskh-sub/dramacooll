00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:02.518
(Episode 87)

00:00:09.598 --> 00:00:10.898
I know you have a busy schedule.

00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:12.628
Thank you for making time for me.

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:16.538
Actually, I was already interested in YL Group,

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:19.668
so when you reached out first, I felt like it was meant to be.

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:25.878
Hello.

00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:30.518
I'm Kang Se Ri, representing Director Noh Sook Ja of JY Gallery.

00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:32.678
I'm also Gi Chan's wife.

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:40.888
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.828
So, you're interested in YL Group?

00:00:49.398 --> 00:00:53.038
Yes, I was looking into a project with Designer L,

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:56.038
and I heard she's working with YL Group.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:58.778
Yes, that's correct.

00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:02.148
She's collaborating with us right now.

00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:07.048
I guess Designer L is as famous as they say.

00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:11.688
She's sensational. And she's very in demand.

00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:15.458
Your Korean is very good.

00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:18.258
My wife came here to interpret for us, though.

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:25.068
My parents always told me never to forget that I'm Korean.

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:28.838
It felt like their dying wish, so I put in a lot of effort.

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.978
Plus, I dated a Korean girl a long time ago.

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:45.288
I've said too much about my life. I'm not usually one to overshare.

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:48.058
Shall we get down to business?

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:53.198
I hear you want not only new artists but new pieces as well.

00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:58.368
So, I'd like to have our gallery's paintings appraised,

00:01:58.838 --> 00:02:01.638
and potentially sell them if the opportunity is right.

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:05.808
I'd like to entrust you with this. What do you say?

00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:15.818
I believe the first step would be for me to see the collection.

00:02:16.118 --> 00:02:18.658
It wouldn't be right to make a rash promise...

00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:19.928
and then back out, would it?

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:23.228
I completely understand.

00:02:23.858 --> 00:02:26.328
Let's set a time to view the art.

00:02:26.768 --> 00:02:27.928
Sounds good.

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:30.768
I have another meeting to attend.

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:34.408
I'll be in touch soon to schedule a date.

00:02:35.168 --> 00:02:36.168
Okay.

00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:52.088
Aren't you leaving?

00:02:52.558 --> 00:02:55.458
No, you go ahead. I have a meeting at Ji Ho's school.

00:02:55.528 --> 00:02:57.258
I have to be there on time,

00:02:57.258 --> 00:02:58.898
so I'll just finish my drink and go.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.328
Whatever else is going on,

00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:01.498
make sure the meeting goes well.

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:03.138
Okay.

00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:23.518
It's been a long time.

00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:27.288
Looks like you made it as an art dealer.

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:28.988
Thanks to you.

00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:30.798
What did I do?

00:03:32.298 --> 00:03:33.568
Forget it.

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:38.468
If you're worried I'll tell him, don't be.

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:41.238
It's all in the past.

00:03:41.568 --> 00:03:42.708
Thank you.

00:03:43.938 --> 00:03:46.578
I was worried about what I'd have to say to convince you.

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:48.448
I'm glad you're being so cool about this.

00:03:49.978 --> 00:03:52.048
Let's keep it that way.

00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:54.788
It would be strange to have any lingering feelings...

00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:57.988
for someone who left without so much as a goodbye.

00:03:58.418 --> 00:04:01.028
Well, I guess we're done then. I'll be going.

00:04:01.088 --> 00:04:02.088
Just one more thing.

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:06.998
Be honest with me.

00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:10.238
The baby you were carrying back then.

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:13.138
What happened to the baby?

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:15.868
What are you talking about?

00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:18.178
- A baby? - When you left,

00:04:18.778 --> 00:04:20.248
I packed your things,

00:04:21.148 --> 00:04:23.478
and I found a pregnancy test and an ultrasound photo.

00:04:26.818 --> 00:04:28.618
I thought you didn't know.

00:04:29.318 --> 00:04:30.318
You did know.

00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:34.758
Our baby...

00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:37.658
is no longer with us.

00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:40.798
I miscarried not long after I left you.

00:04:41.768 --> 00:04:44.568
And it's not like raising a child alone is easy.

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:47.638
I was struggling mentally back then,

00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:49.468
so I think it was for the best.

00:04:54.008 --> 00:04:55.978
Anything else you want to ask?

00:04:57.478 --> 00:04:58.548
No.

00:04:59.618 --> 00:05:01.688
Stick to what you said earlier.

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:04.588
Let's be cool and just move on.

00:05:05.318 --> 00:05:06.318
I'm leaving.

00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:25.978
Here are the files you asked for.

00:05:26.678 --> 00:05:28.048
You should've had Seung Woo bring them.

00:05:28.248 --> 00:05:30.218
He's in a meeting with the PR team.

00:05:30.418 --> 00:05:32.748
And Kang Se Ri took a half-day.

00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:35.388
Since Kang Se Ri got a desk job,

00:05:35.388 --> 00:05:37.488
she's just been getting paid for doing nothing.

00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:42.488
Right, how was dinner last night?

00:05:43.858 --> 00:05:47.228
It went as expected. They weren't happy to see me.

00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:49.368
I guess I just have to try harder.

00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:53.938
They'll come around soon. Hang in there.

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:56.678
Okay. Thanks.

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:00.578
Don't you think we should tell Seung Woo...

00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:02.408
about Mr. Jung?

00:06:04.478 --> 00:06:06.718
I've been thinking about it,

00:06:07.248 --> 00:06:10.418
but he's only recently found out I'm his mother,

00:06:10.858 --> 00:06:12.358
so I'm trying to be cautious.

00:06:12.788 --> 00:06:15.358
Besides, Oh Seong said he needed more time.

00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:18.458
But still, why don't you talk it over with Mr. Jung?

00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:21.368
Time isn't going to solve this on its own.

00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:25.398
You're right. I have to face it sooner or later.

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:35.878
I sent the anonymous dashcam footage for forensic analysis.

00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:36.948
Good.

00:06:37.118 --> 00:06:39.418
How long did they say it would take?

00:06:39.418 --> 00:06:41.448
It seems it'll take a while for a thorough job.

00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:43.458
But we need it done right without any mistakes.

00:06:44.158 --> 00:06:46.858
Kang Seung Woo's car, the one Jae In's mother was driving,

00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:51.058
we must ensure it didn't hit Do Hee, not even a graze.

00:06:51.228 --> 00:06:52.728
We have to be absolutely sure.

00:06:52.998 --> 00:06:54.968
I already requested that.

00:06:57.138 --> 00:07:00.368
(DH Holdings)

00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:03.708
- I'm going to get some fresh air. - Sure, go ahead.

00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:16.218
Last night must have been hard on you.

00:07:17.418 --> 00:07:19.018
I don't see it as a hardship.

00:07:19.858 --> 00:07:23.458
It's nothing compared to the pain I put you through.

00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:28.128
I'm just going to be patient, keep trying, and wait.

00:07:29.938 --> 00:07:31.538
But about Seung Woo...

00:07:31.598 --> 00:07:34.268
What? Did something happen to Seung Woo again?

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:38.078
- How did you hold it in? - What?

00:07:38.808 --> 00:07:42.008
You're bursting with fatherly love at the mention of his name.

00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:47.048
Aren't you going to tell him?

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:49.888
Seung Woo has a right to know.

00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:54.058
You can't keep it a secret forever.

00:07:54.828 --> 00:07:56.428
Of course, he has to know.

00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:01.368
Just think about it.

00:08:03.438 --> 00:08:04.468
I will.

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.178
I've sent the footage of Do Hee's accident...

00:08:10.578 --> 00:08:12.108
for expert analysis.

00:08:12.938 --> 00:08:15.848
That's great. The recording of Do Hee's call...

00:08:15.908 --> 00:08:18.278
was a huge help in getting to the bottom of the case.

00:08:19.548 --> 00:08:22.448
Hopefully, the dashcam footage will give us something, too.

00:08:22.788 --> 00:08:24.718
We'll just have to have faith and wait.

00:08:25.318 --> 00:08:26.418
By the way.

00:08:26.588 --> 00:08:29.128
(YL Planning and Design Team)

00:08:29.228 --> 00:08:30.358
This is for you.

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:35.628
I'm glad I could finally give it to you.

00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:38.838
You know,

00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:44.178
it feels like it's been a long time since we could talk face-to-face.

00:08:46.648 --> 00:08:47.808
I was worried...

00:08:48.448 --> 00:08:51.048
I made you uneasy by bringing all that up.

00:08:51.218 --> 00:08:52.418
It's been bothering me.

00:08:53.148 --> 00:08:54.488
No, not at all.

00:08:54.648 --> 00:08:56.888
You were so careful and considerate...

00:08:57.058 --> 00:09:00.158
when you gathered the courage to tell me.

00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:03.088
Your sincerity really came through.

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:04.658
It's not awkward at all.

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:06.528
That's a relief.

00:09:07.668 --> 00:09:09.298
I'm really good at waiting.

00:09:09.698 --> 00:09:10.968
So please, don't worry about me,

00:09:11.898 --> 00:09:14.438
and just treat me like you always have.

00:09:16.638 --> 00:09:17.638
Thank you.

00:09:37.798 --> 00:09:38.928
I am your father.

00:09:39.398 --> 00:09:40.398
No, that's not right.

00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:41.828
I'm your dad.

00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:47.668
Hi, my son!

00:09:49.638 --> 00:09:51.238
That's definitely not it either...

00:09:51.378 --> 00:09:53.008
I should be feeling a rush of emotion.

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:00.488
Son, it's good to see you.

00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:04.358
Yes, it's good to see you too, Father.

00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:10.998
Sir, what are you doing?

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:12.858
Well, you see...

00:10:12.858 --> 00:10:14.268
I was just...

00:10:14.898 --> 00:10:16.628
Oh, I get it.

00:10:19.538 --> 00:10:20.668
It was for a theatre club, right?

00:10:21.468 --> 00:10:23.438
I heard those are popular these days with office workers.

00:10:23.978 --> 00:10:24.978
What?

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.108
Right, it was something like that.

00:10:27.548 --> 00:10:30.218
You're into acting too?

00:10:30.378 --> 00:10:31.548
You're full of surprises.

00:10:34.818 --> 00:10:37.218
When's the show? Just let me know, and I'll be there.

00:10:38.188 --> 00:10:39.188
Sure.

00:10:40.728 --> 00:10:41.728
Break a leg!

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:44.958
Break a leg.

00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:04.548
- I'm home. - Yun Hee, I'm home too.

00:11:04.878 --> 00:11:06.018
Uncle!

00:11:08.488 --> 00:11:09.648
You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

00:11:10.518 --> 00:11:11.758
I just have to heat up the soup.

00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:12.888
Go change and come on out.

00:11:22.268 --> 00:11:24.768
There's nothing like your cooking.

00:11:24.898 --> 00:11:26.698
I'm telling you, it's the best in the world.

00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:29.468
Why don't you go on one of those cooking shows?

00:11:30.138 --> 00:11:31.938
There are many cooking competitions these days.

00:11:32.138 --> 00:11:34.278
You'd win first place.

00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:35.578
No one else would stand a chance.

00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:38.248
- You should really do it! - Stop buttering me up.

00:11:39.278 --> 00:11:40.388
Just go get changed.

00:11:41.288 --> 00:11:43.048
No, I'm serious. I really mean it.

00:11:43.348 --> 00:11:44.418
Even Mi Ran says...

00:11:44.418 --> 00:11:47.628
she'll never forget the food you made for her back then.

00:11:47.858 --> 00:11:49.188
And she said that it was all so delicious.

00:11:49.758 --> 00:11:51.458
She would've fainted from the sheer deliciousness...

00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:52.598
if she ate this.

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:55.528
I'd be the one fainting if she came over.

00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:57.938
Tell her to forget it. She's never eating my food again.

00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:01.268
Wait...

00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:13.278
- Uncle. - Hey!

00:12:13.348 --> 00:12:17.088
I figured out how Jae In could keep living with us!

00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:21.058
Really? Okay, let's hear it.

00:12:21.228 --> 00:12:23.258
She just has to become my aunt.

00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:25.128
Your aunt?

00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:28.298
Yes, you and Jae In have to get married.

00:12:28.368 --> 00:12:30.268
Then, she'll be my aunt.

00:12:34.708 --> 00:12:36.878
- Hey, should we go out for dinner? - Okay.

00:12:42.108 --> 00:12:43.348
Can't they just tell by looking?

00:12:43.848 --> 00:12:45.578
I'm so classy and elegant.

00:12:46.248 --> 00:12:48.518
I'm better than Choi Ja Young in every way.

00:12:49.288 --> 00:12:51.288
But that pretty boy...

00:12:51.288 --> 00:12:53.588
only talks about Choi Ja Young, calling her "director."

00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:56.958
And all those biddies keep saying, "Choi Ja Young would never do that."

00:12:57.258 --> 00:12:58.698
"She's always been so dignified."

00:12:59.228 --> 00:13:02.098
Honestly, are they all blind?

00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:04.738
She hasn't even been acquitted yet.

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:08.438
Don't tell me she's actually going to be found innocent.

00:13:08.968 --> 00:13:09.968
No.

00:13:10.478 --> 00:13:12.878
All I have to do is trust the young master.

00:13:16.408 --> 00:13:17.418
I'm home.

00:13:17.478 --> 00:13:18.478
Okay.

00:13:18.478 --> 00:13:21.688
Right! The other day...

00:13:22.248 --> 00:13:25.388
Didn't you say Choi Ja Young was sick?

00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:26.958
That's right.

00:13:27.358 --> 00:13:28.988
What's wrong with her? How sick is she?

00:13:29.188 --> 00:13:30.798
Is it something terminal?

00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:33.498
With her pride, she probably wishes she were dead.

00:13:33.798 --> 00:13:35.098
It's Alzheimer's.

00:13:35.368 --> 00:13:37.098
What? What is that?

00:13:37.598 --> 00:13:40.438
So, is it a terminal illness or not?

00:13:40.668 --> 00:13:41.868
Put it in simple terms.

00:13:42.268 --> 00:13:45.538
- Dementia. - What? Dementia?

00:13:46.608 --> 00:13:47.848
Oh my goodness.

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:49.978
You're sure it's dementia?

00:13:50.108 --> 00:13:52.118
Yes. I'm heading out.

00:13:53.918 --> 00:13:55.388
Oh my goodness.

00:13:56.888 --> 00:13:59.958
No wonder she kept repeating herself over and over,

00:14:00.558 --> 00:14:02.728
I thought she was just trying to drive me crazy.

00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.198
This is why they say it isn't over until it's over.

00:14:07.828 --> 00:14:09.228
This is just priceless.

00:14:21.448 --> 00:14:22.448
Ji Ho.

00:14:24.018 --> 00:14:26.448
Mom, I drew a picture.

00:14:27.088 --> 00:14:29.888
That's nice. But try to draw a little better.

00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:32.658
Your lines are all wobbly. Okay?

00:14:32.718 --> 00:14:33.728
Okay.

00:14:34.728 --> 00:14:38.528
Mom, at preschool, we get to visit our parents' jobs.

00:14:39.198 --> 00:14:42.568
Woo Ju and Min Woo got to visit their dads' offices.

00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:45.068
I want to do it too.

00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:48.338
All right. I'll talk to Daddy about it.

00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:51.738
Do you want me to take a look at your drawing too?

00:14:56.148 --> 00:14:59.648
Ji Ho, go draw with your uncle. I'll change and be right back.

00:15:13.028 --> 00:15:17.468
You made a show of boldly cancelling your contract with DH Holdings,

00:15:17.738 --> 00:15:20.198
but now you've gone awfully quiet.

00:15:20.738 --> 00:15:22.338
And from what I hear, the deal with your new investor...

00:15:22.768 --> 00:15:24.338
seems to have fallen through.

00:15:25.178 --> 00:15:26.378
Are you mocking me?

00:15:27.748 --> 00:15:31.078
You set me up and made a fool of me. What are you trying to pull?

00:15:31.218 --> 00:15:32.478
Let's get something straight.

00:15:33.248 --> 00:15:37.518
You are the one who saw DH Holdings' weakness...

00:15:37.518 --> 00:15:39.558
as an opportunity to terminate the investment contract.

00:15:40.158 --> 00:15:41.188
Don't you remember?

00:15:41.628 --> 00:15:45.228
If you want to end the contract, we won't stand in your way,

00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:47.398
but we will have to recall our investment,

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:49.298
and YL Group will take a massive hit.

00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:51.868
After all the work we put into growing this company together,

00:15:52.298 --> 00:15:54.038
I'd hate to be the one to push it off a cliff.

00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:56.308
So, I'll give you a chance.

00:15:57.078 --> 00:15:58.078
That won't be necessary.

00:15:59.138 --> 00:16:01.248
Just get out of YL Group, like I said.

00:16:02.178 --> 00:16:03.778
Please disregard what Chairman Hwang just said.

00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:06.348
Director Kang.

00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:09.388
Our board of directors has decided to stick with DH Holdings...

00:16:09.448 --> 00:16:11.858
and honour the original investment contract.

00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:15.328
The board has already reached a decision,

00:16:15.658 --> 00:16:16.788
so don't you say another word.

00:16:25.498 --> 00:16:27.068
Chairman Hwang, there's a registered letter for you.

00:16:27.368 --> 00:16:29.238
It's from the court, so only you can sign for it.

00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:31.578
Please come in.

00:17:00.968 --> 00:17:03.738
(Summons)

00:17:11.518 --> 00:17:14.088
Looks like something else isn't going your way.

00:17:15.048 --> 00:17:17.218
Oh, that's right!

00:17:17.218 --> 00:17:19.588
Chairman Hwang, I'm sure you know him well too.

00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.458
I mean the chief prosecutor who was up for Prosecutor General.

00:17:26.498 --> 00:17:28.228
We did a little digging on him,

00:17:28.498 --> 00:17:30.298
and it turned out to be a gold mine.

00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:34.808
We compiled proof of his dirty deals and handed it all over,

00:17:35.768 --> 00:17:37.638
so he'll be stripped of his nomination any day now.

00:17:39.178 --> 00:17:40.508
What have you done?

00:17:41.748 --> 00:17:42.808
What a shame.

00:17:43.408 --> 00:17:46.218
Seems you’re flying solo now, Chairman Hwang.

00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:48.948
And now, at last,

00:17:49.388 --> 00:17:51.818
a proper investigation can finally begin.

00:18:02.228 --> 00:18:03.228
What?

00:18:03.598 --> 00:18:05.168
The lead prosecutor was replaced?

00:18:06.968 --> 00:18:08.908
Set up a meeting with the new prosecutor for me.

00:18:09.608 --> 00:18:11.238
I'll find a way to wrap him around my finger.

00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:15.578
Besides, it’s not like there’s evidence pointing to anyone else.

00:18:17.278 --> 00:18:18.978
Okay, I'm counting on you.

00:18:22.688 --> 00:18:23.688
Director Hwang.

00:18:25.118 --> 00:18:27.018
Please spare my life.

00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:29.558
Please let me...

00:18:30.388 --> 00:18:31.858
Please let me live.

00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:38.838
Pull yourself together. Will you ruin everything like this?

00:18:43.978 --> 00:18:45.638
In case you were wondering.

00:18:47.578 --> 00:18:49.808
Here's why you were identified as the new prime suspect.

00:18:50.478 --> 00:18:51.548
So?

00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:53.018
Does it make sense now?

00:18:54.748 --> 00:18:55.818
How...

00:18:56.988 --> 00:18:57.988
How could that be?

00:18:58.118 --> 00:18:59.858
I turned it all over to the prosecution as evidence.

00:19:00.628 --> 00:19:02.688
Stop playing your dirty games and just face the investigation.

00:19:20.008 --> 00:19:22.378
Hello, Princess.

00:19:23.918 --> 00:19:25.518
What's all that?

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:27.848
I'm here to protect you, Princess.

00:19:28.118 --> 00:19:32.018
If any bad guys show up, I'll fight them all off for you.

00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.358
Stay back. You can't come any closer.

00:19:52.278 --> 00:19:53.708
And he's not exactly all there himself.

00:20:04.888 --> 00:20:06.318
It's been a while.

00:20:08.358 --> 00:20:10.588
Who does Ms. Noh think she is, inviting me?

00:20:12.398 --> 00:20:13.628
Noh Sook Ja?

00:20:13.658 --> 00:20:17.168
We're all getting together for tea at Ms. Noh's place.

00:20:18.568 --> 00:20:19.638
Okay.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:22.708
If she wants to meet me so badly, I'll go.

00:20:23.268 --> 00:20:24.678
See you in a bit.

00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:28.278
Now what are they scheming?

00:20:33.718 --> 00:20:35.118
It's time for your medicine.

00:20:36.488 --> 00:20:39.758
- Where are you going? - Noh Sook Ja invited me out.

00:20:41.188 --> 00:20:42.388
You're actually going?

00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:45.298
I think you'd be better off just ignoring her.

00:20:45.658 --> 00:20:47.728
Why wouldn't I? It's not like I have anything to hide.

00:20:48.268 --> 00:20:49.328
She's like a leech.

00:20:49.328 --> 00:20:51.338
The more I avoid her, the more she'll cling.

00:20:51.768 --> 00:20:55.408
If anything should happen, you have to call me.

00:20:56.008 --> 00:20:58.008
I will. Don't worry.

00:20:58.408 --> 00:20:59.908
Take your medicine before you go.

00:21:08.588 --> 00:21:11.318
Welcome to my house.

00:21:15.658 --> 00:21:18.998
I've really been enjoying the Impressionists lately.

00:21:19.098 --> 00:21:22.998
Director Noh, who's your favourite Impressionist painter?

00:21:23.828 --> 00:21:25.568
"The Impressionists?"

00:21:25.898 --> 00:21:30.038
Do you even know what the term "Impressionist" means?

00:21:31.138 --> 00:21:32.478
Of course, I do.

00:21:32.838 --> 00:21:36.578
I guess it means they paint with very stern expressions?

00:21:41.648 --> 00:21:42.718
Or am I wrong?

00:21:43.518 --> 00:21:47.188
Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Berthe Morisot.

00:21:47.288 --> 00:21:48.988
Among the Impressionist painters,

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:52.698
there are quite a few great pieces from lesser-known artists as well.

00:21:52.758 --> 00:21:56.368
You really know your stuff, Ms. Choi.

00:21:57.538 --> 00:22:00.568
Director Noh, could you acquire a piece...

00:22:00.568 --> 00:22:02.908
by the artist Demian?

00:22:03.868 --> 00:22:06.138
Of course, I can get one.

00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:09.608
The only piece by Demian that was recently up for auction...

00:22:09.908 --> 00:22:12.418
was sold to an American millionaire at the end of last year,

00:22:12.478 --> 00:22:14.888
and is barred from resale for several years.

00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:17.288
How exactly were you planning on getting it?

00:22:20.488 --> 00:22:21.888
It must have slipped my mind.

00:22:27.028 --> 00:22:30.728
She said that old hag had dementia, so why is she sharp as a tack?

00:22:30.998 --> 00:22:32.738
She's just like her old self.

00:22:33.098 --> 00:22:36.608
Did that Kang Se Ri lie to mess with me?

00:22:44.118 --> 00:22:46.818
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:22:46.818 --> 00:22:47.888
What now?

00:22:48.588 --> 00:22:50.718
Why are you taking it out on me?

00:22:50.788 --> 00:22:53.918
Hwang Na Ra. This is the office. Watch your mouth.

00:22:55.628 --> 00:22:57.928
The driver just brought Ji Ho from preschool.

00:22:58.598 --> 00:23:01.168
Is it "Bring Your Kid to Work Day" or something?

00:23:04.268 --> 00:23:05.438
Call Se Ri.

00:23:05.868 --> 00:23:07.808
I'll head down as soon as I'm done.

00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:10.638
- Go keep an eye on Ji Ho. - What, Mr. Chairman?

00:23:10.708 --> 00:23:12.438
That's not in my job description.

00:23:14.778 --> 00:23:16.848
Fine. I'll go, all right?

00:23:19.318 --> 00:23:22.288
I know you must be busy. You don't have to accompany me.

00:23:22.418 --> 00:23:25.018
- I can meet them on my own. - It's okay.

00:23:25.718 --> 00:23:28.488
- Did you arrange to meet here? - Yes.

00:23:29.528 --> 00:23:31.228
I reached out to them personally.

00:23:34.828 --> 00:23:37.968
It's about Director Choi Ja Young and her daughter, Kang Jae In,

00:23:37.968 --> 00:23:39.338
you asked me about last time.

00:23:40.568 --> 00:23:41.808
And what did you find out?

00:23:41.868 --> 00:23:45.978
Yes. It was a big scandal in Korea, so it was easy to find information.

00:23:45.978 --> 00:23:48.208
Well, for starters, the daughter, Kang Jae In, is divorced.

00:23:48.448 --> 00:23:51.048
She's the ex-wife of Hwang Gi Chan, the current chairman of YL Group.

00:23:51.818 --> 00:23:53.048
Is that so?

00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:55.418
And it's not just the gallery. The director position, too,

00:23:55.588 --> 00:23:58.888
has been turned over to Noh Sook Ja, Chairman Hwang's birth mother.

00:23:59.788 --> 00:24:00.958
The gallery, too?

00:24:02.628 --> 00:24:04.958
That sounds highly unusual.

00:24:05.358 --> 00:24:08.068
Well, it's kind of a long story.

00:24:12.438 --> 00:24:13.438
Here.

00:24:23.948 --> 00:24:25.178
Ji Ho, sit right here.

00:24:25.518 --> 00:24:26.518
There you go.

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:29.888
Ji Ho, Mom and Dad will be here soon.

00:24:29.888 --> 00:24:32.588
I'm going to get some ice cream and a drink,

00:24:33.758 --> 00:24:36.558
- so you read your storybook, okay? - Okay.

00:24:37.528 --> 00:24:38.728
You're so cute.

00:24:39.098 --> 00:24:41.828
Stay right here. Don't go anywhere. If you need to leave, call me.

00:24:41.898 --> 00:24:43.468
- Okay. - Good.

00:25:12.298 --> 00:25:13.398
Ji Ho!

00:25:14.398 --> 00:25:15.598
Dad! Mom!

00:25:15.668 --> 00:25:18.568
There you are. What has my little guy been up to?

00:25:18.668 --> 00:25:20.138
I was reading a storybook.

00:25:20.198 --> 00:25:22.208
You were? Was it fun?

00:25:22.268 --> 00:25:23.268
Yes!

00:25:24.508 --> 00:25:27.378
- You want some ice cream? - Okay!

00:25:35.818 --> 00:25:37.858
I played the recording for Hwang Gi Chan.

00:25:39.188 --> 00:25:41.728
- How did he react? - He was completely flustered.

00:25:42.128 --> 00:25:44.128
He must've never seen that coming.

00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:48.068
Don't engage with him when you're alone with him.

00:25:48.328 --> 00:25:49.928
There's no point in provoking him.

00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:51.568
It's dangerous.

00:25:52.198 --> 00:25:53.498
I'll be careful.

00:25:53.998 --> 00:25:58.008
I forgot I have somewhere to be. I should get going now.

00:26:04.108 --> 00:26:06.448
Take Ji Ho and show him around the showroom.

00:26:07.048 --> 00:26:08.288
Aren't you coming with us?

00:26:09.048 --> 00:26:13.358
Ji Ho, I'll come when I'm done. So go on ahead with Mom.

00:26:13.588 --> 00:26:15.958
- Okay! - All finished? Ready to go?

00:26:16.028 --> 00:26:17.228
Let's go, Ji Ho.

00:27:00.468 --> 00:27:02.908
Hello? This is Designer L.

00:27:02.968 --> 00:27:04.708
I've just arrived at the cafe.

00:27:04.808 --> 00:27:07.778
Something's come up suddenly. I was hoping we could reschedule.

00:27:08.078 --> 00:27:10.278
I'm so sorry. I should have contacted you sooner.

00:27:10.378 --> 00:27:12.918
Oh, I see. All right.

00:27:28.428 --> 00:27:32.038
Ma'am, after seeing you again in person,

00:27:32.338 --> 00:27:34.868
I'm more convinced than ever that you're innocent.

00:27:35.338 --> 00:27:38.178
I just called because I wanted to tell you to hang in there.

00:27:38.738 --> 00:27:39.938
Is that right?

00:27:40.208 --> 00:27:43.048
Thank you for calling me yourself.

00:27:43.548 --> 00:27:45.718
And with news of a reinvestigation,

00:27:45.718 --> 00:27:48.518
the truth is bound to come out soon.

00:27:49.518 --> 00:27:50.548
"A reinvestigation?"

00:27:51.118 --> 00:27:54.588
- There's news of a reinvestigation? - Oh my, you hadn't heard?

00:27:54.928 --> 00:27:56.928
I'll send you a link to the news story.

00:28:17.508 --> 00:28:19.818
I got one for you when I was getting mine. Please have it.

00:28:20.378 --> 00:28:21.448
Thank you.

00:28:21.618 --> 00:28:23.618
Perfect timing. I was tired. Afternoons do that to me.

00:28:23.618 --> 00:28:25.218
(Managing Director, Kang Mi Ran)

00:28:27.488 --> 00:28:29.558
About my biological father...

00:28:34.028 --> 00:28:36.168
- It's nothing. I'll be on my way. - Seung Woo.

00:28:39.268 --> 00:28:40.438
Are you curious about him?

00:28:43.738 --> 00:28:45.138
I'm of two minds about it.

00:28:46.938 --> 00:28:49.108
He's probably married with a family of his own,

00:28:49.748 --> 00:28:53.548
and I could break up his family if I just showed up.

00:28:54.078 --> 00:28:55.188
That's not true.

00:28:55.918 --> 00:28:57.348
What makes you think you'd be ruining anything?

00:28:58.518 --> 00:28:59.618
You're his son.

00:29:01.588 --> 00:29:02.588
And,

00:29:03.288 --> 00:29:04.458
he's not...

00:29:05.128 --> 00:29:06.228
Hold on.

00:29:08.528 --> 00:29:09.868
Hello?

00:29:11.068 --> 00:29:12.338
I'm right outside.

00:29:15.068 --> 00:29:16.238
I have to step out for a minute.

00:29:23.148 --> 00:29:25.118
You were in there?

00:29:25.548 --> 00:29:27.648
Yes. So, what is this about?

00:29:27.988 --> 00:29:30.218
Hey, do you remember Detective Son Wang Sik...

00:29:30.288 --> 00:29:31.718
you met at the police station?

00:29:32.318 --> 00:29:35.058
Did you ever thank him for his help?

00:29:35.328 --> 00:29:37.028
No, I haven't.

00:29:37.588 --> 00:29:39.358
I figured as much.

00:29:40.498 --> 00:29:43.598
When someone helps you out, you need to thank them properly.

00:29:43.668 --> 00:29:45.538
Go give him this and say thank you.

00:29:47.838 --> 00:29:49.008
Thank you.

00:29:49.868 --> 00:29:51.168
To me?

00:29:52.208 --> 00:29:54.008
For the advice.

00:29:55.248 --> 00:29:58.778
You know, my father always used to say something to me.

00:29:58.878 --> 00:30:01.918
Never forget what's precious and always be grateful.

00:30:03.888 --> 00:30:05.618
You're just as admirable as my father.

00:30:07.058 --> 00:30:09.688
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol certainly raised him well.

00:30:10.258 --> 00:30:11.598
Sir.

00:30:12.458 --> 00:30:13.798
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

00:30:18.268 --> 00:30:20.538
Seung Woo, let's have a coffee break.

00:30:21.608 --> 00:30:24.008
I actually have to stop by the police station.

00:30:25.908 --> 00:30:27.108
Here, you can have mine.

00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:29.448
You don't mind, do you?

00:30:29.778 --> 00:30:30.778
Well...

00:30:33.678 --> 00:30:35.088
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

00:30:45.858 --> 00:30:48.268
YL Group, Planning and Design.

00:30:49.698 --> 00:30:51.638
Mr. Kang Seung Woo?

00:30:51.638 --> 00:30:53.198
He's not at his desk now.

00:30:54.498 --> 00:30:56.208
Oh, is this Ms. Choi Ja Young?

00:30:56.468 --> 00:30:58.138
Hello, this is Hwang Na Ra.

00:31:00.038 --> 00:31:01.978
He went to the police station.

00:31:03.578 --> 00:31:04.578
Hello?

00:31:05.578 --> 00:31:06.578
Did we get cut off?

00:31:07.048 --> 00:31:08.048
Hello?

00:31:08.918 --> 00:31:11.888
Thank you so much for your help the other day.

00:31:14.658 --> 00:31:17.258
It was the right thing to do.

00:31:19.198 --> 00:31:22.268
You know, there's quite a resemblance.

00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:24.768
Like who?

00:31:27.168 --> 00:31:29.208
Don't!

00:31:31.978 --> 00:31:34.848
No, Seung Woo didn't do anything wrong.

00:31:34.908 --> 00:31:36.608
He doesn't know anything.

00:31:36.948 --> 00:31:38.318
I...

00:31:38.648 --> 00:31:39.848
I...

00:31:41.048 --> 00:31:42.648
I'm the one who killed her.

00:31:43.248 --> 00:31:45.718
I killed Kim Do Hee!

00:32:25.498 --> 00:32:28.968
(Queen's House)

00:32:30.898 --> 00:32:32.198
Mister...

00:32:32.768 --> 00:32:33.768
My mom...

00:32:34.838 --> 00:32:36.808
My mom's been acting strange.

00:32:37.238 --> 00:32:41.078
My father and Kim Do Hee...

00:32:41.978 --> 00:32:44.678
Are you saying it was all on Hwang Gi Chan's orders?

00:32:44.878 --> 00:32:47.178
You may not remember,

00:32:47.178 --> 00:32:49.218
but we were once married.

00:32:50.118 --> 00:32:53.158
Yun Hee, don't freak out, but listen carefully.

00:32:53.418 --> 00:32:56.488
I have a kid.

00:32:56.558 --> 00:32:58.198
I'm going to ask you one last time.

00:32:58.758 --> 00:33:00.258
The baby you were carrying...

00:33:01.258 --> 00:33:02.828
Is the baby really dead?
