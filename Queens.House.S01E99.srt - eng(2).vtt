00:00:01.094 --> 00:00:02.364
(Episode 99)

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:03.704
Who gave you permission to die?

00:00:05.064 --> 00:00:08.204
Just because you're dying from some incurable disease,

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:11.944
you think I'll feel sorry for you and forgive you?

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:16.314
Do you think I'm out of my mind?

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:20.614
Even if you die,

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:23.384
I will never forgive you.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.194
Hwang Gi Chan.

00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:32.994
So live.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:35.994
Do whatever it takes...

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:40.474
to get every possible treatment and fight for as long as you can.

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:44.174
Live.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:48.244
Take responsibility for...

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.214
all your sins...

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.314
and get the punishment you deserve.

00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:56.624
Don't hide behind your illness like a coward.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:01.594
Live.

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:16.374
Right now,

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:19.004
do you have any idea how happy I am?

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:22.414
Because of all people,

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:26.044
you're the one telling me to live.

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:29.654
Telling me that I'm allowed to.

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:33.594
When I said I was dying,

00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:38.424
I thought you'd be more thrilled than anyone.

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:46.064
Don't...

00:01:47.274 --> 00:01:48.534
do anything you'll regret.

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:52.044
At least, for Eun Ho's sake,

00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:55.074
be a father he won't be ashamed of when you're gone.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.184
- Ji Ho! Mom's home! - For goodness' sake.

00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:08.754
- Ji Ho! - I told you, he's in kindergarten!

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:11.864
You have some nerve showing up here after what you did to my son.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.194
What am I doing? I should be calling the police.

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:16.494
Mother, you can't report me.

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:18.104
You know better than that.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:19.604
What are you talking about?

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:20.934
And why can't I?

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:26.244
Because I have definitive proof that Gi Chan murdered Kim Do Hee.

00:02:26.874 --> 00:02:27.974
Are you really okay with that?

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:31.084
You're lying!

00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:33.354
That's all just circumstantial evidence or something.

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.484
If you had real proof, he would've been arrested ages ago.

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:36.924
Do you want me to show you?

00:02:43.464 --> 00:02:45.864
(Dashcam Footage)

00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:50.164
Do you still doubt that I have his life in my hands?

00:02:52.364 --> 00:02:53.374
So,

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.744
how are you threatening my mom, using my life as collateral?

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.774
It's a misunderstanding. I just want to be with you.

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:01.144
Mom, what are you doing?

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.844
I told you to call the police the second you saw her.

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:06.654
Honey, I was wrong.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:08.654
Get your filthy hands off me!

00:03:09.754 --> 00:03:11.454
Do you expect me to forgive you who tried to kill my brother?

00:03:12.584 --> 00:03:14.124
What are you doing, Mom? Call the police.

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:16.794
Right.

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:30.104
Gi Chan,

00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:34.474
we can't report her, and we can't throw her out.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:36.644
What are you talking about?

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.284
The video of you hitting Kim Do Hee with your car.

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:43.424
She has it on that dashcam or whatever it's called.

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:46.584
What if she goes to the police just to save her own skin?

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:50.764
No. You must restore our family's name.

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:53.634
You can't go to jail. Absolutely not.

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.534
Mom, I'm dying.

00:03:58.064 --> 00:03:59.204
I know.

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:02.134
I'm sure you feel like you're dying because of that witch.

00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:03.974
I get it.

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.944
But we have to cover up what we can.

00:04:07.474 --> 00:04:10.584
Even if you can't stand her, just grit your teeth and bear it.

00:04:10.584 --> 00:04:12.214
We have to think about the future.

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:15.214
- All right? - I'm about to die.

00:04:17.124 --> 00:04:19.254
What are you talking about?

00:04:19.684 --> 00:04:22.424
What do you mean you're dying?

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:24.524
Your son...

00:04:26.264 --> 00:04:28.564
doesn't have much time left to live.

00:04:29.294 --> 00:04:31.534
Don't even joke about that. It's bad luck.

00:04:38.004 --> 00:04:41.914
Are you just trying to scare your mother?

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:46.914
It's stomach cancer.

00:04:49.084 --> 00:04:50.084
Terminal stomach cancer.

00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:53.524
My son.

00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:58.894
My son is going to die?

00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:03.434
It can't be.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.034
Gi Chan.

00:05:07.134 --> 00:05:08.334
It's not true, is it?

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:09.704
Right?

00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:17.184
Oh, no. This can't be happening, Gi Chan.

00:05:17.944 --> 00:05:20.954
If you die, how am I supposed to go on?

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:24.554
I can't live without you.

00:05:25.254 --> 00:05:27.194
I can't go on.

00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:31.764
Gi Chan. It can't be true.

00:05:32.224 --> 00:05:34.164
Gi Chan is terminally ill?

00:05:34.994 --> 00:05:36.334
He's dying.

00:05:37.134 --> 00:05:39.034
So, Gi Chan is actually going to die?

00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:41.474
Right.

00:05:42.104 --> 00:05:44.704
I have to stick it out if I want to get Ji Ho's inheritance.

00:05:50.614 --> 00:05:51.844
Honey.

00:05:55.284 --> 00:05:57.724
I heard about you dying. What nonsense is this?

00:05:58.084 --> 00:05:59.084
It's not true, right?

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:00.254
Right?

00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:03.464
You're not dying. Why would you be dying?

00:06:04.124 --> 00:06:05.324
It's none of your business.

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:07.734
- Get out. - I'm not leaving.

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.334
I'll do what it takes to save you.

00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:14.034
- I won't let you die. - Oh, no.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:18.004
How could fate be so cruel?

00:06:20.074 --> 00:06:22.744
After all the offerings I've made,

00:06:23.414 --> 00:06:26.044
first, you made one of my sons a fool,

00:06:26.514 --> 00:06:30.324
and now you're taking the pillar of our family.

00:06:31.484 --> 00:06:33.624
Darn it all.

00:06:36.224 --> 00:06:37.464
Hey, why is everyone crying?

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:39.964
Did something happen to our family again?

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.174
I can't go on.

00:06:52.204 --> 00:06:54.944
I can't live without my Gi Chan.

00:06:57.014 --> 00:07:00.954
With that good-for-nothing idiot burden of a son,

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:04.084
how am I supposed to survive on my own?

00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:09.024
I can't go on.

00:07:13.464 --> 00:07:14.464
I can't?

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:16.134
Why not?

00:07:18.764 --> 00:07:19.764
I have to.

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:22.834
The living have to find a way to survive.

00:07:23.874 --> 00:07:25.104
Wait a minute.

00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:30.384
Oh, right.

00:07:36.084 --> 00:07:39.524
The one I took out on Gi Man. And the one I took out on Na Ra.

00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:43.594
Here it is. The life insurance for Gi Chan.

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.864
Thank goodness I never missed a payment.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:56.304
Hold on. I have to keep paying the premiums.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:59.104
Then I can at least get the payout when Gi Chan is gone.

00:08:00.444 --> 00:08:02.344
I guess I'll have to sell something.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:11.824
(Certificate of Insurance)

00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:14.594
This one is a limited edition. It'd be a shame to sell it.

00:08:16.354 --> 00:08:17.894
You know Uncle is building our new house.

00:08:18.524 --> 00:08:20.334
He said you should pick out a bed for it.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.764
Your uncle is really something else.

00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:27.974
Can I help you find something?

00:08:28.504 --> 00:08:31.404
Yes, my mom is on her feet all day,

00:08:31.474 --> 00:08:34.344
so her back has been bothering her, and her legs swell up often.

00:08:34.444 --> 00:08:36.844
You need a bed with firm support.

00:08:37.384 --> 00:08:38.714
Why don't you lie down here?

00:08:39.544 --> 00:08:40.954
Go ahead and try it, Mom.

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:55.064
It's so comfortable and plush. It feels really supportive too.

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.464
The right mattress can make a big difference...

00:08:56.464 --> 00:08:57.804
in your body's recovery.

00:08:58.334 --> 00:09:01.934
Thanks to you, I'll finally be able to get a comfortable night's sleep.

00:09:02.504 --> 00:09:04.844
I just want you to be comfortable, at least when you're sleeping.

00:09:07.274 --> 00:09:08.274
Yes.

00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:12.944
- I'm off to a meeting. - Okay.

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:15.584
- Please, have a seat. - Thanks.

00:09:22.754 --> 00:09:24.924
I promised Ji Ho I'd get him a gift.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.734
But neither Kang Se Ri nor Hwang Gi Chan is answering my calls.

00:09:28.494 --> 00:09:32.364
I feel like I might have told Hwang Gi Chan about Ji Ho too soon,

00:09:32.434 --> 00:09:33.534
and now I'm worried.

00:09:34.934 --> 00:09:36.004
I'll look into it.

00:09:40.744 --> 00:09:41.874
Hello?

00:09:48.884 --> 00:09:50.014
Thank you for coming.

00:09:50.684 --> 00:09:51.684
No one's home right now.

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:55.894
This is a gift for Ji Ho.

00:09:56.424 --> 00:09:57.424
This one, too.

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.794
Teo asked me to pass this on.

00:10:01.194 --> 00:10:03.264
How's Ji Ho doing?

00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:09.034
Where is Ji Ho? Is he in his room?

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.504
He's in kindergarten.

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:15.744
There's something I need to tell you about Gi Chan.

00:10:18.814 --> 00:10:21.454
I heard he was very sick.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.894
Could you please forgive him?

00:10:28.854 --> 00:10:30.624
Could you please save him?

00:10:31.724 --> 00:10:34.094
It's not my place to say anything.

00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:36.664
That's up to him, isn't it?

00:10:37.464 --> 00:10:39.364
But if you say something, he might...

00:10:40.504 --> 00:10:44.074
I'll go put this in Ji Ho's room. Where is it?

00:11:03.764 --> 00:11:04.764
(Mr. Hong)

00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:11.364
It's me, Mr. Hong.

00:11:11.964 --> 00:11:14.174
I need some pocket money in here.

00:11:14.534 --> 00:11:16.134
Send some money to my commissary.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.844
What? Cat got your tongue?

00:11:20.374 --> 00:11:24.544
You know if I talk to prosecutors, you'll end up in here too.

00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:26.684
You can't just blow me off.

00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:28.914
Am I wrong?

00:11:30.114 --> 00:11:32.784
Fine. Just text me the account number.

00:11:39.894 --> 00:11:40.994
I found a cell phone.

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:45.064
It's Kang Se Ri's.

00:11:45.804 --> 00:11:48.474
I just found this at Hwang Gi Chan's place.

00:11:48.534 --> 00:11:51.074
Hong Man Su used this phone to call Se Ri.

00:11:51.504 --> 00:11:55.214
It's password-protected, so I couldn't see what's on it,

00:11:55.274 --> 00:11:57.844
but I think Kang Se Ri might have been using it...

00:11:57.844 --> 00:11:59.284
for criminal activities.

00:11:59.814 --> 00:12:01.084
That would make sense.

00:12:01.584 --> 00:12:03.854
Why else would she need two phones?

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:07.954
It's likely a burner phone, but we should check to be sure.

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:12.224
If we want to see what's inside, we have to crack the password first.

00:12:12.294 --> 00:12:13.764
I'll take it to a specialist.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.264
I'd appreciate that.

00:12:19.164 --> 00:12:20.234
Dad.

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:24.404
I don't want to go to kindergarten.

00:12:24.774 --> 00:12:26.274
Do I have to go?

00:12:32.714 --> 00:12:33.714
Why?

00:12:34.054 --> 00:12:35.684
Did you fight with your friends in kindergarten?

00:12:39.784 --> 00:12:41.594
Ji Ho, it's okay.

00:12:41.824 --> 00:12:43.254
You can tell me anything.

00:12:45.024 --> 00:12:46.264
What happened?

00:12:48.164 --> 00:12:49.164
Look at me.

00:12:51.164 --> 00:12:53.834
Dad, are you a bad person?

00:12:56.104 --> 00:13:00.274
My friends say you and Mom are bad people.

00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:03.914
You're not, right? Right, Dad?

00:13:16.494 --> 00:13:19.264
A clean home is a healthy home.

00:13:25.034 --> 00:13:26.104
(If something happens to me, Se Ri is behind it.)

00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:29.074
"If something happens to me, Se Ri is behind it."

00:13:34.114 --> 00:13:35.514
"Not a match?"

00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:37.584
Mom.

00:13:38.144 --> 00:13:39.644
I made some noodles. Do you want some?

00:13:39.884 --> 00:13:42.754
Hey, look at this. What is this?

00:13:47.184 --> 00:13:48.694
What is it? Why are you so surprised?

00:13:49.024 --> 00:13:50.124
Ji Ho...

00:13:50.424 --> 00:13:51.664
It says...

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.364
Ji Ho isn't Gi Chan's son.

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:58.404
What? What does that mean?

00:13:58.804 --> 00:14:01.774
Wait, if he's not Gi Chan's son, then whose son is he?

00:14:09.774 --> 00:14:11.514
Hey, look at this.

00:14:11.914 --> 00:14:13.144
Na Ra is saying...

00:14:13.284 --> 00:14:15.914
this means he's not your flesh and blood.

00:14:16.014 --> 00:14:18.024
Take Ji Ho and Gi Man and go play outside.

00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:20.584
What? Okay.

00:14:21.524 --> 00:14:24.824
Ji Ho, let's go to the playground. You come too, Gi Man.

00:14:24.894 --> 00:14:27.024
Really? The playground! This will be fun!

00:14:27.094 --> 00:14:29.934
Na Ra, push me on the swing! The swing!

00:14:36.434 --> 00:14:37.944
Don't say anything to Ji Ho.

00:14:38.774 --> 00:14:41.674
Is it true? Is Ji Ho really not your son?

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:43.514
Genetics don't matter.

00:14:44.114 --> 00:14:46.844
I raised him as my son, so he is my son.

00:14:47.484 --> 00:14:51.384
Don't be ridiculous! That darn Kang Se Ri.

00:14:51.524 --> 00:14:54.594
How dare she make a cuckoo's nest in our family?

00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:56.494
And the real father?

00:14:56.754 --> 00:14:58.564
Do you even know who the real father is?

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:00.694
It's Teo.

00:15:01.064 --> 00:15:02.364
Lee Teo, the art dealer.

00:15:03.434 --> 00:15:05.434
Oh, no.

00:15:06.804 --> 00:15:09.474
They must think our family's a joke.

00:15:09.604 --> 00:15:13.004
How could they be so shameless, parading around us without a care?

00:15:15.244 --> 00:15:16.644
Mother, what's wrong?

00:15:17.684 --> 00:15:19.114
What's going on?

00:15:19.444 --> 00:15:22.954
You witch! I could tear you apart! You darned cuckoo witch!

00:15:23.054 --> 00:15:26.454
You dared bring another man's seed into the Hwang family!

00:15:26.824 --> 00:15:29.694
Mother, I can explain everything.

00:15:30.024 --> 00:15:31.794
Explain what?

00:15:31.794 --> 00:15:35.364
That you passed off another man's child on my son as his own?

00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:37.134
What is there to explain? Just die!

00:15:39.134 --> 00:15:41.174
Die! Just die, you witch!

00:15:41.704 --> 00:15:46.074
Stop, you're going to kill me! Mother, you'll be a murderer!

00:15:46.244 --> 00:15:49.414
Fine by me. Killing you would be worth it.

00:15:49.474 --> 00:15:51.844
- You witch, die! Die! - Mother!

00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:53.584
Stop it, please!

00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:57.954
Don't you dare say a word of this to Ji Ho.

00:15:58.584 --> 00:15:59.824
It's not his fault.

00:16:19.304 --> 00:16:21.644
So when are you going to send the commissary money?

00:16:22.474 --> 00:16:24.044
What are you talking about?

00:16:24.414 --> 00:16:28.384
You said on the phone you'd send it. Are you backing out now?

00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:31.324
Wait a second.

00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:33.424
What do you mean I took a call earlier?

00:16:33.754 --> 00:16:35.394
Who? Me?

00:16:36.154 --> 00:16:38.064
Who else would answer your phone?

00:17:05.684 --> 00:17:06.724
Na Ra,

00:17:07.424 --> 00:17:09.124
did anyone come by the house?

00:17:09.554 --> 00:17:12.894
Jae In came by. She brought food and toys for Ji Ho.

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.794
Kang Jae In was here?

00:17:17.034 --> 00:17:18.234
Got it.

00:17:20.004 --> 00:17:22.034
Okay, Se Ri. Calm down.

00:17:22.504 --> 00:17:26.374
The phone is password-protected, so it'll take her a while to get in.

00:17:26.874 --> 00:17:30.074
And if she tries to recover files, it'll take even longer.

00:17:30.214 --> 00:17:34.514
I just need to grab everything I can and leave Korea before she does.

00:17:37.314 --> 00:17:41.594
You seem to be doing so well lately, and it makes me happy too.

00:17:42.724 --> 00:17:45.064
After my dementia diagnosis,

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:49.894
I realized how few things in life are actually important.

00:17:51.764 --> 00:17:54.274
You practically raised your brother like a son,

00:17:54.704 --> 00:17:57.544
so I'd be furious and resentful too if I were you.

00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:01.974
Just try to open your heart a little.

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:05.514
Just a tiny crack.

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:07.114
Just a tiny bit.

00:18:09.654 --> 00:18:11.754
I thought you were going to tell me to forgive them completely.

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.354
Just a little bit?

00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:18.764
If you had wanted to cut them off, you could have kicked them out.

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:22.764
If you open your heart just a bit, you're already halfway there.

00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:25.134
The rest is up to them.

00:18:33.104 --> 00:18:35.944
You said you'd come pick her up, Min Jun.

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:38.114
Thanks to you, we had a really nice chat.

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:40.744
Next time, you and Bo Ram should come to our place.

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:45.484
Ready to go?

00:19:03.704 --> 00:19:04.874
We're home.

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:08.874
We ran into Jae In's mom and Min Jun on our way in, so we said hi.

00:19:09.074 --> 00:19:10.514
You've been seeing them a lot lately?

00:19:11.344 --> 00:19:14.714
She's been doing really well lately, which is a relief.

00:19:16.654 --> 00:19:19.424
You two. Go bring me that thing.

00:19:21.824 --> 00:19:22.824
That thing?

00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:26.294
For the new house we're moving into.

00:19:26.524 --> 00:19:28.364
The blueprints was it?

00:19:28.994 --> 00:19:30.664
I want to take another proper look.

00:19:31.134 --> 00:19:32.304
So bring it here.

00:19:33.204 --> 00:19:34.934
The house where we'll all live together?

00:19:35.234 --> 00:19:36.534
You want to see the blueprints for that house?

00:19:38.704 --> 00:19:39.874
- I'll go get it. - Okay.

00:19:43.214 --> 00:19:44.314
Yun Hee.

00:19:44.914 --> 00:19:46.184
Thank you.

00:19:46.444 --> 00:19:48.654
I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:52.124
That's so cringey. Get away from me.

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.394
I'm just saying I'll wait and see how it goes.

00:19:54.654 --> 00:19:56.724
I'm not forgiving you completely.

00:19:56.994 --> 00:20:00.994
I'm just opening a tiny, tiny crack.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:05.064
That's good enough for me. I'll work to open it all the way.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.264
Don't you worry.

00:20:16.114 --> 00:20:17.884
All this time, we thought he was our own flesh and blood.

00:20:18.314 --> 00:20:22.154
We treated him as the precious heir who would succeed Chairman Hwang.

00:20:22.414 --> 00:20:23.614
We gave him...

00:20:23.614 --> 00:20:27.654
the best of everything, from food to clothes, and you name it.

00:20:28.054 --> 00:20:29.454
I mean your son, Hwang...

00:20:29.524 --> 00:20:31.294
Oh, that's right. Just Ji Ho.

00:20:31.794 --> 00:20:32.964
I'm aware.

00:20:33.624 --> 00:20:37.064
Then shouldn't you be on your knees thanking me right now?

00:20:37.234 --> 00:20:40.004
After my whole family was tricked into raising him?

00:20:40.964 --> 00:20:43.674
Do you have any idea what it cost us to raise your son?

00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:46.704
I'm going to get that money back. Now, pay up.

00:20:50.144 --> 00:20:54.754
They say a child thrives best when raised by their birth parents.

00:20:55.414 --> 00:20:57.054
So if you pay the right price,

00:20:57.484 --> 00:21:00.354
even if my Gi Chan says no, I'll hand the boy over to you.

00:21:00.424 --> 00:21:01.494
Are you telling me...

00:21:02.154 --> 00:21:04.524
I have to buy my own son back from you?

00:21:05.024 --> 00:21:07.894
As an art dealer, you of all people should understand.

00:21:08.164 --> 00:21:12.034
Limited editions are worth more, and the seller names the price.

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:16.834
If someone cared for your child, it's only fair that you pay them.

00:21:17.574 --> 00:21:20.044
Look, I'm not asking for much.

00:21:20.144 --> 00:21:23.344
Just the cost of his food, clothes, and shelter so far.

00:21:23.644 --> 00:21:26.484
Let's say three million dollars. That's practically pocket change.

00:21:26.544 --> 00:21:27.984
Noh Sook Ja!

00:21:28.814 --> 00:21:32.024
Who are you to get angry with your elders, you punk?

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:35.324
I'm taking my son back. I don't need your permission.

00:21:35.924 --> 00:21:38.324
And I have no intention of haggling over him like he's some product.

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:41.664
We're done talking. Get out.

00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:42.934
Get out!

00:21:43.194 --> 00:21:45.764
Darn it, fine! I'm leaving!

00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:50.834
Darn it! If you won't pay, you can forget taking Ji Ho back.

00:21:50.974 --> 00:21:53.474
You just sit back and watch what I do to him!

00:22:04.884 --> 00:22:06.184
It's me.

00:22:06.524 --> 00:22:08.024
We need to meet. Right now.

00:22:19.134 --> 00:22:21.874
Your mother demanded money from me for raising Ji Ho.

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:23.974
Three million dollars.

00:22:27.644 --> 00:22:29.144
Are you in on this?

00:22:30.614 --> 00:22:31.814
I can't believe all of you are making a business deal...

00:22:31.814 --> 00:22:32.914
out of a child.

00:22:33.614 --> 00:22:36.054
And the way all of you treat Ji Ho like property...

00:22:37.384 --> 00:22:39.684
I'll report you all for child abuse or whatever I can.

00:22:41.354 --> 00:22:43.924
I recorded every awful thing your mother said.

00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:46.894
That wasn't my idea.

00:22:47.964 --> 00:22:49.394
I never agreed to it.

00:22:50.594 --> 00:22:53.004
Even after I found out Ji Ho wasn't my biological son,

00:22:53.434 --> 00:22:54.774
nothing has changed for me.

00:22:55.604 --> 00:22:56.674
Ji Ho...

00:22:57.534 --> 00:22:59.374
is the son I raised.

00:23:08.984 --> 00:23:11.524
He can't stand to pay for his own son's care?

00:23:13.854 --> 00:23:15.454
What are you doing over there?

00:23:15.654 --> 00:23:16.894
It's nothing, Mother.

00:23:17.194 --> 00:23:18.724
Stop! Get over here.

00:23:22.164 --> 00:23:25.534
Wait a minute. Why are my official seal and ID card in here?

00:23:26.104 --> 00:23:28.374
- Mother, about that... - You...

00:23:29.204 --> 00:23:30.204
Give that here.

00:23:34.544 --> 00:23:38.244
Why do you have Gi Chan's life insurance certificate?

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:39.884
Hold on a second.

00:23:40.984 --> 00:23:43.554
Why isn't my name listed as the beneficiary,

00:23:43.884 --> 00:23:45.254
and why is your name here instead?

00:23:48.524 --> 00:23:53.394
You little witch. You planned to steal my son's money?

00:23:54.094 --> 00:23:57.164
Yes. I changed the beneficiary to my name.

00:23:57.464 --> 00:23:58.464
Is there a problem?

00:23:58.864 --> 00:24:00.864
What? What did you just say?

00:24:01.104 --> 00:24:03.334
Before it's your son's insurance money,

00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:07.504
it's insurance money that my son, Gi Chan's son, should receive.

00:24:08.044 --> 00:24:09.714
Why should you be the one to collect it?

00:24:10.514 --> 00:24:12.884
He has a child, and he has a wife right here.

00:24:12.944 --> 00:24:15.154
What are you talking about? Gi Chan doesn't have a son.

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:17.254
It's bad enough we were tricked into raising that boy,

00:24:17.584 --> 00:24:19.424
but now you're trying to steal his life insurance?

00:24:20.984 --> 00:24:23.124
It's my son's life insurance, so it's mine!

00:24:23.494 --> 00:24:25.694
And it's for my husband's life too!

00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:29.364
You call yourselves a family?

00:24:30.694 --> 00:24:31.804
Your son is dying,

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:34.004
your husband is dying,

00:24:34.804 --> 00:24:36.974
and you're fighting over who gets my life insurance?

00:24:38.204 --> 00:24:40.274
You're trying to cash in on my life insurance...

00:24:40.274 --> 00:24:41.344
before I'm even dead?

00:24:42.844 --> 00:24:43.844
Oh, no...

00:24:53.454 --> 00:24:57.154
Gi Chan, how am I meant to live without you?

00:24:57.224 --> 00:24:59.294
I was just so scared, that's why...

00:24:59.694 --> 00:25:02.664
Honey, no matter what, Ji Ho is your son.

00:25:03.234 --> 00:25:05.534
And that's why you're not abandoning him.

00:25:05.934 --> 00:25:07.604
So, everything that you leave behind...

00:25:07.934 --> 00:25:10.874
- should go to Ji Ho. It's his. - Shut up!

00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:13.244
I said, shut up.

00:25:27.524 --> 00:25:28.624
Is this the insurance company?

00:25:30.294 --> 00:25:34.394
Hi, I'd like to cancel a change of beneficiary...

00:25:34.764 --> 00:25:36.434
and change it back to the original person.

00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:39.334
Yes, that's right.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:43.904
Thanks for coming to see me.

00:25:44.844 --> 00:25:45.844
I didn't think you would.

00:25:51.174 --> 00:25:52.344
When I hit my breaking point,

00:25:54.284 --> 00:25:56.684
all I could think about was you.

00:25:59.184 --> 00:26:00.184
It's pathetic, isn't it?

00:26:05.524 --> 00:26:06.824
My own mother, and even Kang Se Ri,

00:26:08.064 --> 00:26:09.994
they're family, but they don't even tell me to live.

00:26:13.034 --> 00:26:14.534
They're so blinded by money...

00:26:15.834 --> 00:26:17.274
that instead of caring about me dying,

00:26:19.074 --> 00:26:21.814
they're greedy for the insurance money they'll get when I'm gone.

00:26:25.944 --> 00:26:28.284
I guess that's why I thought of you even more.

00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:34.754
You were the only one who told a guy like me to live.

00:26:36.454 --> 00:26:38.424
What's the point of saying that now?

00:26:40.564 --> 00:26:43.294
I'm not the one who will be by your side.

00:26:51.374 --> 00:26:52.374
Jae In, I'm sorry.

00:26:53.844 --> 00:26:54.874
I was wrong.

00:26:56.144 --> 00:26:57.514
I was wrong about everything.

00:27:02.314 --> 00:27:03.714
I'm so scared, Jae In.

00:27:04.824 --> 00:27:05.824
Just like this...

00:27:07.284 --> 00:27:09.294
I'm so scared of dying all alone.

00:27:12.424 --> 00:27:13.764
In my final moments,

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.234
could you...

00:27:19.364 --> 00:27:21.304
be the one by my side?

00:27:25.274 --> 00:27:27.874
Please, Jae In, I'm begging you.

00:27:29.744 --> 00:27:30.744
Hwang Gi Chan.

00:27:33.544 --> 00:27:34.984
You're going to suffer in the abyss.

00:27:36.754 --> 00:27:40.554
Which means you'll never see our Eun Ho again.

00:27:42.224 --> 00:27:43.494
But even so, if...

00:27:45.094 --> 00:27:46.094
by some sheer coincidence,

00:27:47.864 --> 00:27:50.064
even on your way to the underworld,

00:27:51.364 --> 00:27:52.604
and if by some complete accident,

00:27:54.334 --> 00:27:55.774
you happen to meet our Eun Ho,

00:27:58.344 --> 00:28:00.074
I hope you face him as a father...

00:28:00.904 --> 00:28:02.974
who used to have a shred of a conscience.

00:28:06.614 --> 00:28:07.844
Whatever time you have left,

00:28:10.614 --> 00:28:12.084
I hope you can live without any more regrets.

00:28:15.224 --> 00:28:17.724
That's all I have left to say to you.

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:07.274
- A bite for Mom. - For me?

00:29:07.344 --> 00:29:09.644
- Oh, my. - It's delicious.

00:29:09.874 --> 00:29:11.444
Hwang Eun Ho! What do you think you're doing?

00:29:11.714 --> 00:29:13.584
I'm going to Mom!

00:29:13.984 --> 00:29:14.984
Go to your room!

00:29:15.484 --> 00:29:17.754
Go to your room and think about what you did! Right now!

00:29:24.254 --> 00:29:25.594
Mom...

00:29:27.964 --> 00:29:28.964
Eun Ho.

00:29:30.564 --> 00:29:31.734
Daddy is sorry.

00:29:33.804 --> 00:29:35.274
Daddy is so sorry.

00:29:37.574 --> 00:29:38.574
Daddy...

00:29:40.674 --> 00:29:42.244
was such a terrible father.

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:44.314
I'm sorry.

00:30:09.334 --> 00:30:10.674
Hello, sir.

00:30:12.104 --> 00:30:14.644
Well, hello there.

00:30:23.284 --> 00:30:26.784
Ji Ho, do you remember what I told you?

00:30:27.384 --> 00:30:28.394
Yes.

00:30:28.724 --> 00:30:33.524
You said you and Mom are going away for a long, long time for work,

00:30:33.764 --> 00:30:38.064
and if I go live with Teo in the US, you promised you'd come and see me.

00:30:39.134 --> 00:30:41.234
You're really coming, right, Dad?

00:30:43.304 --> 00:30:45.204
Of course I will.

00:30:48.044 --> 00:30:49.044
Ji Ho.

00:30:50.074 --> 00:30:52.144
I'm sorry I couldn't play with you more.

00:30:55.684 --> 00:30:57.454
How about a hug?

00:31:12.164 --> 00:31:13.164
Ji Ho.

00:31:14.264 --> 00:31:16.604
Don't cry until I get back.

00:31:18.004 --> 00:31:19.304
Listen to Teo,

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:22.374
and stay strong and healthy for me.

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.014
All right?

00:31:24.474 --> 00:31:25.484
Okay.

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:29.414
Dad, you can't cry either, even if you miss me.

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:31.414
You have to be brave and healthy, too.

00:31:33.584 --> 00:31:34.584
Okay.

00:31:44.894 --> 00:31:47.634
All the necessary legal documents are in here.

00:31:50.104 --> 00:31:51.104
Please...

00:31:52.404 --> 00:31:53.504
take good care of Ji Ho.

00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:56.874
Of course. Don't worry.

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:04.914
What do you mean there's new evidence?

00:32:07.624 --> 00:32:09.354
A face-to-face interrogation with Jae In?

00:32:10.394 --> 00:32:13.694
To find out that Kang Se Ri ordered Hong Man Su to kill Jae In...

00:32:14.494 --> 00:32:17.864
and whether I knew that led to Eun Ho's death?

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:21.464
Even on your way to the underworld,

00:32:22.374 --> 00:32:25.744
if you happen to meet our Eun Ho,

00:32:27.244 --> 00:32:28.674
I hope you face him as a father...

00:32:29.714 --> 00:32:31.574
who used to have a shred of a conscience.

00:32:33.684 --> 00:32:34.684
No.

00:32:35.254 --> 00:32:37.814
I'll go to the police by 2pm tomorrow and tell them everything.

00:33:57.034 --> 00:33:59.864
(The final episode airs tomorrow.)
