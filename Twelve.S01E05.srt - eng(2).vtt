00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:40.142
TAESAN ORIENTAL MEDICINE CLINIC

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.904
Seriously? You're still not ready?

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.328
Let's go. Malsook's almost here.

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:04.750
Come on.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.923
So, are you really not coming?

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:13.842
That's right. I'm not.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:16.845
So much for whining about missing her.

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.264
Who are you saying I've been missing?

00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:21.600
I was carrying out my duty, nothing more.

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:25.604
Says the man who always visited her
on his days off.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.273
Whatever, you brat.

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:30.108
Don't forget to tell her this.

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:32.736
She shouldn't even dream
about seeing me again. Got it?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.904
I'm hanging up.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.616
As if he won't go see her again.

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.371
Don't worry. I'll explain well later.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.749
Where's Chief and the others?
They're not around.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.585
In the Philippines for work.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.545
The Philippines? That's out of the blue.

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:53.882
The boss of the Vipers gang
sold the nightclub and fled at night.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.094
They all flew there
just to hunt that guy down? Why?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.431
He was scared of flying alone.
He's never been on a plane before.

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:02.849
Who, Chief?

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.893
Isn't he way too big to be afraid?

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.312
Couldn't he have taken just one of them?

00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:09.856
Doni was excited about the food,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.693
and Wonseung leapt at the chance
to be somewhere warmer.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:13.985
And Jwidol?

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.446
They made him tag along to locate the guy.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.407
It never gets any easier.

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.742
- Let's go.
- Come on.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.161
Bangwool, you ride shotgun.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.499
I'm impressed, though.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.543
Chief? Or the others?

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.044
No, the boss of the Vipers gang.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.172
How could he even consider
running off with Chief's money?

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:35.799
Tell me about it.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.593
Chief should focus on collecting,
not lending.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.514
- Collecting…
- This is because he comes off as a softie.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.933
A softie?

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.936
- What are you talking about?
- It's obvious.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.856
Chief's too cute for his own good.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.691
He's like a little kitten.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.192
Right?

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.780
All right. Off we go.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:03.702
I'm fine.

00:04:04.453 --> 00:04:06.872
I don't think you're fine.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.718
Mmm.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.061
Who made this?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.815
Why? How does it taste?

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.526
Why does budae jjigae
taste like caramel macchiato?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.570
Let me try it.

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:49.790
Geez, that tastes awful!

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:56.171
Bangwool, wait!

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:59.716
I told you to just observe.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.844
That just ruined my appetite.

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:04.846
I should've just gone
to the Philippines with Chief.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.767
What are you doing?
We were going to grill them as is.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:13.814
No, don't that.

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.565
Stop!

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.568
- It'd be a disaster if you get sick.
- Tell me about it.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.239
We don't eat just
to end up vomiting, but she won't listen.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.698
Bangwool, come on.

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:25.158
Stop it, Bangwool.

00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.827
Would you please stop?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.911
Bangwool, please.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:29.120
Mirr!

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:31.915
Bangwool.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.753
What took you so long?

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.381
You haven't eaten, right?

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.260
Why is Bangwool pouting?
Did something happen?

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:44.970
Of course not. Have a seat.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.014
- Would you like some caramel macchiato?
- Is there caramel macchiato?

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.432
Yes, and it tastes amazing.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.393
She's pissed.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.189
- Just let it go.
- Mirr, help.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.151
Bangwool, what about the thing
I asked for?

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:09.327
Give it to Doni, not me.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.706
He'll need it one day.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:18.587
Hey, come have some sweet potatoes.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.671
Sure.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.633
- Careful, it's hot.
- Here we go.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.805
Mirr, get over here.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.671
TWELVE

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.430
Malsook, are you okay?

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.599
He's no joke.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.351
Obviously, Malsook.

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.602
I have no other choice.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.200
What's that?

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.702
- What is it?
- Oh…

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.246
Hey, what's wrong?

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:37.499
Man, that's tasty.

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.418
Huh?

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.373
They're persistent, aren't they?

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.875
You've got to be kidding me.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:44.769
Bangwool?

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:46.813
Bangwool!

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.932
Geumsoon?

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:05.516
Geumsoon!

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.435
Marok!

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.745
Geumsoon, no.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.169
Chief.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.672
Chief!

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:19.674
Chief.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.571
Taesan.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.780
Geumsoon is…

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.703
Geumsoon.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.664
Mister…

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.640
Geumsoon.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.956
Hey, are you okay?

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.751
It hurts, Malsook. Let's go.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.423
Let's hurry.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.764
DOLMEN SUSEOK FOLK MUSEUM

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:41.209
TAESAN BUILDING

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:43.502
Where's Bangwool?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.922
Bangwool!

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.971
Goodness.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.203
What the… What happened here?

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:21.707
Bangwool!

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.501
- What.
- Oh, no.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.714
- Bangwool, wake up.
- Bangwool?

00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:30.800
Are you okay?

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.595
Bangwool, what happened?

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.643
Bangwool, where…

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.813
Hey, what happened here?

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:44.897
Hey.

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:47.149
What happened?

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.693
They took Mirr away.

00:17:48.776 --> 00:17:49.777
- What?
- What?

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.113
Who was it?

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:55.825
Samin came with his goons,
and Bangwool's injured.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:57.868
Samin?

00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:00.621
Bangwool.

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:03.165
Are you all right?

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:06.836
She's good.

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:10.131
- Tend to Geumsoon.
- Sure.

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.217
Taesan,

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:19.765
it seems they attacked Geumsoon
to distract us

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:21.517
and take Mirr away.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.439
I'll find them and kill them all.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:28.065
Taesan.

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:31.819
The pendant is not responsive.

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.446
Wonseung found their lair.

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:35.364
That's where they must be!

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:36.616
You saw it yourself.

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:39.452
The place has been warded off
by a dark magic barrier.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:41.621
If they find out about our plan,

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.624
it'll put Mirr in bigger danger. Got it?

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.506
Bangwool, Geumsoon is severely injured.

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:56.636
Let's go to her. Jwidol, Kangji,
get us hot water and towels.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:57.720
- Sure.
- Got it.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.193
Taesan.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.281
I'll try to find

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.201
a solution as soon as possible,

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.703
so give me some time.

00:20:17.007 --> 00:20:18.008
Bangwool.

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:19.844
How's Geumsoon?

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:25.516
What…

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:27.268
She's getting worse.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:31.355
A wound caused by an evil spirit's venom
can't be cured with human medicine.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.111
She'll do everything she can,

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:40.740
but sadly, Geumsoon is beyond help.

00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:42.616
This is bad.

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:46.495
- They even have Mirr now.
- Darn it.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:48.622
Is there no way at all?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.421
The Hellmouth.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.718
By opening the Hellmouth,

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:02.970
we might be able to regain our powers.

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.389
Bangwool's powers will be restored too,

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.933
and she could save Geumsoon.

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:09.059
No.

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.230
That's not guaranteed.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.358
And opening the Hellmouth

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.736
could further endanger the human world.

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:26.035
This is tough.

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:28.496
Where's Chief?

00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:31.832
He's with Geumsoon.

00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:39.376
No… Don't you worry.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.337
I'll save you. Get out of here.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.963
No…

00:24:18.332 --> 00:24:19.458
Where am I?

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.172
What is this place?

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:01.894
Wait. You saw Ogwi and Samin?

00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.064
- Yes.
- Where?

00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:09.026
Tell me. Where was it?

00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:11.278
Will you take accountability
if something happens to Mirr?

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.572
I'm sure Marok will loop us in
in due time.

00:26:13.655 --> 00:26:15.074
Take a chill pill.

00:26:15.157 --> 00:26:16.784
Listen to Wonseung, Malsook.

00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:19.828
Are you seriously siding with him now?

00:26:19.912 --> 00:26:22.623
If we were to act,
we should do so as a team.

00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:25.375
- Didn't you learn anything from earlier?
- Whatever!

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.128
Go on and waste your time waiting, then.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.256
I'll get Marok's approval
and go alone if I must.

00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:34.218
I told you to cool it.

00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:36.095
Besides, Marok left earlier.

00:26:36.178 --> 00:26:37.387
Did he go to work?

00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:39.181
Earlier,

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:41.058
we made a mess at the mall.

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:43.060
Of course, police officers
must've been called in.

00:26:43.143 --> 00:26:45.229
Why would Marok go there?

00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.730
Doni, not you too.

00:26:46.814 --> 00:26:48.774
He's out doing his job as a detective!

00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:50.025
Marok quit the force!

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.111
What?

00:26:58.826 --> 00:26:59.952
Hey, Wonseung!

00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.162
Where are you going?

00:27:11.713 --> 00:27:12.714
Chief.

00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:15.050
Marok left without telling anyone…

00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:19.096
…and something doesn't feel right.

00:27:28.063 --> 00:27:32.651
I'll try to find a solution
as soon as possible,

00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:35.404
so give me some time.

00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.489
Please.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.636
Let us begin.

00:33:41.102 --> 00:33:43.313
- I'll protect you.
- The prayer has begun.

00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:45.190
- I'll save you.
- You will be sealed.

00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:47.150
I will end you myself.

00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:07.439
Mirr!

00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:16.484
How long has he been gone?

00:37:17.694 --> 00:37:19.529
Well, about an hour.

00:37:28.413 --> 00:37:32.000
Samin, how have you managed
to stay alive all this time?

00:37:32.709 --> 00:37:34.169
That's ironic,

00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:36.671
coming from a human being.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.759
I'm no ordinary human.

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:43.762
I'm the human

00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:45.472
handpicked by God.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.107
The grown-ups are talking…

00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:58.026
…so know your place.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.330
Now,

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:13.208
Samin, I want to know how you've managed

00:38:14.501 --> 00:38:15.752
to stay alive all this time.

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.107
Geez.

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:42.654
Come on, boys.

00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:44.948
Does anyone here have any manners at all?

00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:47.116
Look at yourselves.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.118
One, two, three, four, five, six…

00:38:49.202 --> 00:38:52.413
Do you even need this many of you

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:55.124
just to take out good old me? Come on.

00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:57.710
By the way,

00:38:59.629 --> 00:39:01.381
let me share an amusing fact…

00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:05.009
before you die.

00:39:08.304 --> 00:39:09.305
See this?

00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:15.186
You see, this staff
has three hidden features.

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.120
One.

00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:35.540
It vanquishes puny spirits like you.

00:39:36.249 --> 00:39:37.500
Two.

00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:40.295
It allows me to split and channel

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.922
my maximum power.

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.266
Three.

00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:58.229
It's pathetic that I have to
explain this as well.

00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:01.733
You know what? The third power

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.651
is something for you to think about

00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:06.154
when you get bored
on your way to the underworld.

00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:07.864
Got it?

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:25.590
You puny brat.

00:40:27.926 --> 00:40:29.135
Way to go.

00:40:53.242 --> 00:40:54.243
Huh?

00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:05.964
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:49.382
Not even God

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:52.093
will be able to save you.

00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:05.064
Did you awaken Haetae's soul?

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:10.361
You want to know?

00:42:11.738 --> 00:42:13.364
I spent thousands
of years praying…

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.119
so that I could open the Hellmouth.

00:42:56.866 --> 00:42:57.992
Is this the end?

00:42:58.076 --> 00:42:59.786
No, of course not.

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:01.704
No… I'll save you.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:04.415
We need to get out of here.

00:43:04.499 --> 00:43:06.542
Let's get going for now.

00:43:06.626 --> 00:43:08.836
Mirr, I…

00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:14.008
No.

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:15.343
No…

00:43:16.094 --> 00:43:17.303
Ogwi, no.

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:37.532
Please don't do this.

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.200
Move.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.911
Taesan, please. Don't do this.

00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:45.373
We lost members of our family.

00:43:46.249 --> 00:43:47.750
Now, move.

00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:50.461
Don't!

00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:08.062
You defied God

00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:10.690
and brought ruin to the world.

00:44:12.692 --> 00:44:14.902
You've already ruined my everything.

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:17.822
Do as you wish.

00:44:19.657 --> 00:44:20.908
I will end you myself.

00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:30.626
No…

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:39.010
No, don't.

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:42.263
Please don't.

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.556
No…

00:44:54.317 --> 00:44:55.693
What do you think you're doing?

00:44:55.776 --> 00:44:56.986
Don't worry.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:02.033
I only erased Mirr's memories of Ogwi.

00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:03.826
What? Marok!

00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:06.871
This is God's will.

00:45:08.331 --> 00:45:09.957
Leave first with Mirr.

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.419
I'll deal with Ogwi.

00:45:34.106 --> 00:45:35.191
Mirr.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.443
Mirr…

00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:40.613
Mirr!

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:42.657
Ogwi.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.076
It's time for you to pay for your sins.

00:45:46.452 --> 00:45:47.870
There was a time

00:45:47.954 --> 00:45:50.498
when you lived amicably with the angels.

00:45:51.457 --> 00:45:53.542
For that, I offer my last mercy,

00:45:53.626 --> 00:45:55.461
erasing Mirr from your memories.

00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:58.756
You will be sealed in Hell for eternity,

00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.801
and you'll be neither dead nor alive.

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.637
Finish me instead.
