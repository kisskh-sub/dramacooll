00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.810
Tomorrow is the much-anticipated Christmas Eve.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.910
The streets are filled with the Christmas spirit.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.770
Today is the second day of our Christmas special.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.330
We're joined by Miki Mama! Welcome!

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.630
Hello, everyone!

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.860
Using just this clay pot,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.050
you can make a roast chicken-style dish
that the whole family will love.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.360
Roast chicken in a clay pot...

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.860
The deadline for the list is tomorrow.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.690
My 40th...

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.550
birthday.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.030
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.770
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.890
I think people would rather have fried chicken than cake.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.060
- Huh?
- Why?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.210
Don't you think?

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.770
No way.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.180
Huh?

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.370
It's more about the experience of eating it.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.870
Is it a choice between cake and fried chicken?

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.460
Wait, isn't it turkey?

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.950
Oh, turkey? I see.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.720
But...

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.630
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.930
I'm not doing the list.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.860
I'd already decided that,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.730
but I can't bring myself to delete it.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 12)

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.950
Hey.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.450
Oh.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.190
Ah...

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.450
I have a meeting here in a bit.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.210
- I'll get out of your way.
- No, it's fine.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.190
No, I'll just work over there.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.200
Please don't avoid me.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.390
I'll just work over there.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.070
No...

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.990
That's not what I meant.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.500
The 24th...

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.990
Do you have any plans?

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.140
Huh?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.540
Wednesday, the 24th.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.090
It's your birthday, Suzume-san.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.910
No...

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.930
Tanaka-san, sorry to keep you waiting!

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.330
- Kasukabe-san, hey.
- Hey.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.550
Ah...

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.990
He's a senior colleague from my old department.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.410
I'm Kasukabe.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.610
I'm Tojo.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.630
He's my boss in my current department.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.120
Tanaka-san always speaks highly of you.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.750
Not at all, it's the other way around.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.450
I'm always counting on him to clean up my messes.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.030
This guy's always been reliable.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.950
In fact, he's the one who usually tells me off.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.450
Huh? Is that true?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.580
It is.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.070
You know, you may have a gentle way of speaking,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.070
but your jabs are ruthless.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.800
- Oh, right.
- Huh?

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.980
The 24th.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.760
Should we grab a drink in front of the station?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.700
I heard they have a discount for singles.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.250
I'm rounding up guys without girlfriends.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.290
Ah, well...

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.950
- That day, I...
- Keishi.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.490
He's free on the 24th.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.070
Our department has been really busy lately.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.720
We haven't had any chance to go out.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720
So,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.360
please be sure to take him with you.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.660
Thank you.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.560
I'll make the reservation then.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.550
I'll add Tanaka-san for the 24th.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.690
This is for the best.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.410
This way...

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.800
- Hey!
- Why are they both iced?

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.150
'Cause I like them.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.470
Which one do you want?

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.400
I'll take this one.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.250
Okay.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.090
Both of these are intense.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.020
My daughter keeps telling me I'll get a beer belly.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.990
Sakura-chan?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.360
No, Aoi-chan.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.520
She says the ideal body has abs.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.630
That sounds like something Aoi-chan would say.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.350
Suzume.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.130
Thanks for the other day.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.510
No, thank you. I had a great time.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.280
That's good.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:21.870
What's wrong?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120
It's nothing.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.080
It's just that...

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.030
Lately... has something... happened?

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.330
What's with the vague question?

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.870
It was Sakura-chan.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.350
She said you seemed down when you went home.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.770
That's not true.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.410
That girl, Sakura-chan,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.890
she has sharp instincts.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.480
Much sharper than mine.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.540
You know...

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:05.790
I'm always selfishly wishing for your happiness, Suzume.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.760
I'm already... very... happy.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.610
Yeah.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.540
- Yeah.
- Do I have to pay for this?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.990
This is your birthday present.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.300
- It's a day early, you know.
- I did that on purpose.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.870
Kuroki.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.600
Yeah?

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.060
Thanks.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.660
- I'm heading out.
- See you.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.500
It's not Tanaka-san's fault.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.160
It's not anyone's fault.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.330
I made all these decisions myself.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.820
If I just delete it,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.480
my 40th...

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.320
birthday.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.690
I'm having Christmas dinner with my boyfriend tonight.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.170
So it ended up being a Christmas present.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:02.970
Akane-chan.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.860
Um...

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.040
Do you want to have dinner together tonight?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.520
Oh, but today...

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.130
It's Christmas Eve, but I have to work, you know.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.780
You still want to ask me out, knowing that?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.300
- You idiot.
- What?

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.670
Of course I do.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:15.880
Tojo-san.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.290
I've sent over the influencer list.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.220
Got it. I'll check it tomorrow.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.050
Yes, sir.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.590
- Um...
- Everyone.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.970
Since it's Christmas Eve today,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.000
let's head home early.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.450
I still have work to do...
I have to at least finish this.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.530
No way.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.020
Isn't it annoying?

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:44.960
No.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.470
- I can finish if I'm under pressure.
- I'm putting you under pressure right now.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.370
Hurry up.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.930
That's true, but...

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.690
Let's just finish our work first.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.120
Almost sold out!

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.510
Chicken legs, half price!

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.940
Welcome back.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.730
Good evening.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.160
I've got chicken legs.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.020
Buy one. It's Christmas Eve, after all.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.340
A Christmas cake?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.800
Ah... something like that.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.710
I've got something good here, too.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:09.910
A little present for you.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.340
Look! Candles!

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.710
Huh?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.500
Are these for birthdays?

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.820
Ah, it's fine.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.040
It's just like any other day.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.310
But it's still delicious like this.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.520
My 40th birthday.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:43.950
Just like this...

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.340
Okay, smile!

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.090
I told you not to take my picture.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.500
You have to cherish every moment of daily life.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.920
I won't forget.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.270
'Cause I'm the one who caught it.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.660
You look just like a dad on vacation.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.250
You've really been paying attention to me, haven't you?

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:36.930
Huh?

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.010
Does it bother you?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.480
For today...

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.040
let's leave it at this.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.520
I don't want you to think I only came here for that.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.640
Why do you have to do everything by yourself?

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.560
Please don't get used to it.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.090
At times like this,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.270
you're supposed to rely on others.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600
This...

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.180
it's not something you can do alone, is it?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.320
Tojo-san.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.410
Good evening, Suzume-san.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.670
Being prepared...

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.820
Being prepared... you don't need that at all!

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.510
Just being with you is enough for me, Suzume-san.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.820
Suzume... Suzume-san!

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.740
That's right.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.110
Suzume-chan.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.000
Don't give up.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.600
You have to tell him how you really feel.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Keishi!

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.700
Keishi!

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.560
Keishi!

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.940
Keishi!

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.700
Suzume-san...

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.290
Suzume-san...

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.860
Why...

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.460
I felt I had to tell you properly.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.280
Even though you...

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.700
you've been trying so hard to face this...

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.970
But I'm the one who's been running away.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.210
I have to tell you the truth.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.670
Okay.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:21.830
I'm here.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.860
I'm listening.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.980
I...

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.320
I deleted the list.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.000
I thought if I just erased it all...

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.230
everything about the list,

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.560
and everything about you...

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.820
I could forget everything.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.700
I thought I could go back to being on my own...

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.740
But...

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.790
I can't.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.730
I can't forget.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.890
The memories we made...

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.680
They're all...

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.050
They're still right here,
and I can't make them go away!

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.890
Suzume-san...

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.430
I'm your boss.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.020
I'm so much older than you.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.420
We shouldn't be doing this.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.460
But...

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.940
I can't live without you.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.550
So...

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.430
I want to take you home.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.240
Me too.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.770
I was on my way to your place, Suzume-san.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.320
Keishi.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:32.710
Someone might see...

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.210
I don't care if they see.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.380
I don't care what they say.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.820
If something happens...

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.290
then...

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.980
we'll figure it out together.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.880
Together.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.470
Okay...

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.600
Suzume-san...

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.030
You're 40.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.260
So, four candles.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.250
Happy birthday, Suzume-san.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.700
I'm so glad I made it.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.080
Thank you.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.680
Did you make a wish?

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.740
My wish...

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.610
I'm about to make it.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.810
Huh?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.250
Keishi,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.800
be my boyfriend.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.280
Yes.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.370
Happy birthday, Suzume-chan.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.420
Good morning.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.760
Suzume-san.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.970
Did you sleep well?

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.570
I slept great.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.750
- Oh, they both look so good!
- Which two are they?

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.950
Strawberry and melon.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.410
- This is such a hard choice.
- I know, I can't decide.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.900
If we don't decide soon, our lunch break will be over.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.760
You're right.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.090
But I want both.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.470
If it were me,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.820
I'd probably go with strawberry.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.190
Then...

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.710
The melon is tempting, but I'll go with strawberry...

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.520
Ready to order?

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.090
- Excuse me, we're ready to order.
- Certainly.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.120
What can I get for you?

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.460
I'll have the strawberry parfait, please.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.790
Okay, one strawberry parfait.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.000
And for you?

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.120
And one muskmelon parfait, please.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.240
One muskmelon parfait.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.840
- Yes, that'll be all.
- Okay.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.150
- I'll be right back with those.
- Thank you.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.090
Is it because I couldn't decide?

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.860
I can't wait.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.990
Whoa...

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.900
Sembikiya!

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.070
You know it's gonna be good.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.860
Here is your strawberry parfait.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.180
- And your muskmelon parfait.
- Thank you.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:53.630
Excuse me.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.540
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.510
Whoa! It's beautiful!

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:58.710
This is amazing...

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.750
It looks so delicious!

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.690
Okay, well...

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.030
Let's dig in.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.330
- This is so good!
- So good!

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.620
Incredible.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.100
What are you looking at?

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.610
You're just so cute.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.870
Don't be ridiculous.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.720
There's nothing cute about a 40-year-old man.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.360
Huh? Why not?

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.940
It doesn't matter if you're one or 40.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.350
The person you love always looks cute.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.510
This is really good.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:48.610
It is.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.030
Hey, stop taking pictures!

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.420
But you look great.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.890
Now that we've checked "parfait" off the list,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.530
what's next?

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.230
Should we make a "Things to Do Before 41" list?

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.620
No.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.510
We don't need a list.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.400
As long as I'm with you,

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.390
I'm happy no matter what we do.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.430
Yeah.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.790
This is my...

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.460
happy, undramatic, everyday life.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.500
