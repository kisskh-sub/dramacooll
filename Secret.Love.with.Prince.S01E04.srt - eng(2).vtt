Prism is a frigging phantom.

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:11.600
Unbelievable numbers.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.608
No way.

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:19.905
Ace Subaru, alongside Yamato, Maki and Kei.
[Prism's debut song achieves historic success!]

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:23.702
And they're releasing another new song next month?

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:26.775
Such momentum.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:31.578
Listen up, you've already been idols
for three years.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:36.710
Show them that you're the boss
at tomorrow's music show.

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:44.507
Next up is Terzetto.

00:02:44.507 --> 00:02:48.568
Both Subaru and Yamato have really transformed
since joining the group.

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:49.773
Alright, it's done!

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:51.910
Even as newcomers,
they're already the King Prism, right?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.064
- Their presence is on another level.
- Thank you very much.

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:58.222
It's alright.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.269
The top spot belongs to Terzetto.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.497
Ever since we decided to become idols,
we've only aimed at the top.

00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:09.972
After all, Matsuri's older brothers
are the coolest in the world.

00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:11.765
Terzetto, please take the stage.

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:14.000
- Got it.
- Coming.

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:27.649
- The rival.
- Come with me for a bit.

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.044
Huh? Wait a second.

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:34.325
Hey, I'm just here to see Terzetto!

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.431
Prism is my enemy!

00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.961
Am I an enemy too? Your enemy?

00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:41.948
Not exactly.

00:03:41.948 --> 00:03:44.595
But still, I'm part of Terzetto's family.

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:46.498
And I'm your lover.

00:03:49.003 --> 00:03:51.321
Stop it.

00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:57.007
If a scandalous affair with a sister gets exposed,
it'll be the end of his idol career.

00:03:58.496 --> 00:03:59.791
Huh?

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:05.489
The end of his idol career?

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.975
Come back to me.

00:04:07.975 --> 00:04:09.470
Matsuri.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.437
What?

00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:21.916
Choose me instead of Azusa.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.404
Subaru, how could you?

00:04:26.404 --> 00:04:28.719
Do you hate me?

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.246
No way, of course I like you.

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:39.257
It's you who have always been right by my side,
always laughed with me.

00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:47.079
The reason I long for a sibling relationship
is only because of you.

00:04:49.553 --> 00:04:56.455
Matsuri, I'll play with you
until you no longer feel lonely.

00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:05.747
Matsuri,
do you know why I became an idol?

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:10.847
Why?

00:05:10.847 --> 00:05:12.333
Alright, that's a wrap.

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.529
Thank you very much.

00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:18.457
Looks like Terzetto's performance is over.

00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:21.793
Go back to them.

00:05:23.466 --> 00:05:24.733
Yeah.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.385
- Next one.
- Alright, next one!

00:05:36.724 --> 00:05:38.192
This is so annoying.

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:39.806
What?

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:42.819
She totally sees me as just a big brother.

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.945
Don't underestimate yourself, Subaru.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.399
We're the great Prism, you know.

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:51.678
But Subaru, what's so good
about that little sister of yours?

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:55.821
- I wouldn't exactly call her charming.
- That's enough.

00:05:56.853 --> 00:05:59.278
You guys don't need to understand.

00:05:59.278 --> 00:06:01.779
Jeez, Matsuri, you idiot.

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.919
I'll definitely make you fall for me again.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.141
Record comments from each person one by one.

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.602
- I'll go first.
- Please, this way.

00:06:13.592 --> 00:06:19.810
I'm going to become the Number One prince,
and the top idol in Japan.

00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:23.255
Isn't he super motivated?

00:06:23.255 --> 00:06:25.466
He's an attention seeker.

00:06:30.312 --> 00:06:32.092
Hey, good show.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.250
You, too.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.303
Prism is amazing, huh?

00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:42.427
We just finished our performance,
but everyone is only talking about Prism.

00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:47.267
What is it?

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:50.845
What are we lacking?

00:06:51.636 --> 00:06:55.803
You're pretty relaxed about
talking about love rivals.

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.107
Huh?

00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:01.238
I heard about it from Matsuri.

00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:06.418
Romantic rivals or not, it doesn't matter.

00:07:06.418 --> 00:07:10.120
I just want to humbly learn whenever I can.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.476
Are you saying you can
separate personal life from work?

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.611
Don't act so cool.

00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:19.867
That's annoying.

00:07:27.164 --> 00:07:31.646
I'm not planning to give up on Matsuri.

00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:39.275
If you underestimate me,
I'll really steal her away.

00:07:46.168 --> 00:07:49.088
Congratulations on your long-awaited idol debut.

00:07:49.088 --> 00:07:50.461
Thank you very much.

00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:54.497
Your debut song is themed
around first love, right?

00:07:54.497 --> 00:07:56.688
Yes, that's right.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.190
My first love was a childhood friend.

00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:12.899
But we got so close
that we ended up like siblings.

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.481
"I wish I had a big brother like this!"

00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:17.401
And then I got turned down.

00:08:18.976 --> 00:08:22.531
In the end, I was never taken seriously even once.

00:08:23.284 --> 00:08:27.905
The person he had a first crush on,
could it possibly be Matsuri?

00:08:27.905 --> 00:08:29.549
What?

00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:31.922
No, no, not at all!

00:08:31.922 --> 00:08:33.088
So, it's not you?

00:08:33.088 --> 00:08:35.834
Besides, this guy must've had
way too many childhood friends.

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:41.419
Got turned down, huh?
National heartthrob, tough luck!

00:08:42.819 --> 00:08:46.059
I just felt that I had to protect her.

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:48.491

Subaru, do you have a fever?

- Gotta keep you warm.

I can force you to love me back.

do anything weird to you, did he?

00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:18.233
Yeah. It's over.

00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:20.372
So, let's go.

00:15:20.372 --> 00:15:22.727
The agency is throwing a party.
It's a hot spring trip.

00:15:22.727 --> 00:15:26.453
Huh? You mean me too?

00:15:26.453 --> 00:15:29.270
Of course. It's a family trip.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.847
All the artists will be there.
We've booked the whole place.

00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:33.680
That sounds amazing!

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.533
Alright everyone, pack your things.
We'll leave in 30 minutes.

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:37.882
Okay!

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.833
I'm not that open-minded, though.

00:15:46.833 --> 00:15:47.997
Huh?

00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:49.742
I'm super jealous.

00:15:49.742 --> 00:15:51.838
What's with nursing him back to health?

00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:55.477
That doesn't sound like you.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.061
Yeah, exactly.

00:16:00.323 --> 00:16:04.763
When I'm in front of you,
I don't really have much composure.

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:18.608
Matsuri,
did Subaru do something to you?

00:16:20.463 --> 00:16:23.520
Ah, no, that's not what it looks like.

00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:39.047
Oh, little sister. You're here.

00:16:39.047 --> 00:16:40.750
Hello.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:47.010
All of them are heading
to the president's place.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.754
I know. I'm heading there too.

00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:53.237
Sorry.

00:16:57.474 --> 00:17:02.079
You came with your family,
but it must be boring to be alone, right?

00:17:04.337 --> 00:17:07.217
- Shall we drag Terzetto out here?
- No way!

00:17:07.217 --> 00:17:12.594
It's okay, but thank you.

00:17:14.507 --> 00:17:19.839
By the way, have you heard there's another
open-air bath with a beautiful view?

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.100
- Is there?
- Apparently, it's really nice.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.602
Why don't you go check it out?

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.133
Thank you!

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:34.433
Onsen, lovely onsen...

00:17:41.596 --> 00:17:46.115
[Open-air bath - Men's large bathhouse]

00:17:47.957 --> 00:17:49.289
What?

00:17:50.459 --> 00:17:52.834
- Huh?
- No!

00:17:52.834 --> 00:17:54.647
Azusa? What are you doing here?

00:17:54.647 --> 00:17:57.530
This slot is for men.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.748
Sorry, I'm leaving now.

00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:03.926
Huh?

00:18:03.926 --> 00:18:05.519
Huh?

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:07.698
Someone's coming! Hide!

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.166
I'll figure something out.

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.737
Can you stay still for a while?

00:18:12.737 --> 00:18:14.107
Yeah.

00:18:16.101 --> 00:18:18.226
Huh? Hi there, Azusa.

00:18:18.226 --> 00:18:19.878
Hey, Subaru.

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:31.516
Are you skipping the party too?

00:18:31.516 --> 00:18:32.764
Yeah.

00:18:34.442 --> 00:18:40.113
- Um, Subaru, you...
- Azusa, are you sulking or something?

00:18:40.113 --> 00:18:41.317
Huh?

00:18:42.295 --> 00:18:45.246
You'd never skip something like this.

00:18:47.833 --> 00:18:51.551
If it's because I told you not to act so cool,
then I'm sorry.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:19:01.906
No, just as you said,
I am not cool or anything like that.

00:19:02.988 --> 00:19:09.988
That's why I'm extremely annoyed
about you leaving a kiss mark on Matsuri.

00:19:12.473 --> 00:19:14.489
A kiss mark, huh.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.782
- You said you'd steal her away, but I...
- You know what?

00:19:20.782 --> 00:19:26.923
Compared to this cool version of me,
she preferred the weaker me from the past.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.275
She even got mad at me
for badmouthing the old me.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:40.548
It seems like I have to beat the old me
before I can compete with you.

00:19:42.696 --> 00:19:51.692
Azusa, I'm not planning to give up and
as long as Matsuri likes you, I'll hate you.

00:19:51.692 --> 00:19:53.798
But you see...

00:19:54.623 --> 00:19:58.147
As an idol, I think you're a good competitor.

00:20:02.047 --> 00:20:04.894
I look forward to working with you.

00:20:07.494 --> 00:20:10.054
Well, I'll head out now.

00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:27.013
Azusa.

00:20:27.013 --> 00:20:34.705
Somehow, I think I understand
why you're attached to Subaru.

00:20:35.328 --> 00:20:36.631
Huh?

00:20:39.369 --> 00:20:43.170
Sorry, I got dizzy.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.704
This is bad.

00:20:45.692 --> 00:20:48.317
Huh? Wait a minute!

00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:51.182
Are you okay?

00:20:52.154 --> 00:20:55.555
I want to rest on your lap
for a completely different reason.

00:20:57.031 --> 00:20:59.914
Any reason is fine with me.

00:20:59.914 --> 00:21:04.330
Spending time with you like this
makes me incredibly happy.

00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:12.138
I wish we could take a bath together,
so that I can hold you tight.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:17.229
That hickey is so annoying,
and that guy's smug attitude,

00:21:17.229 --> 00:21:20.148
I should've just punched him.

00:21:20.148 --> 00:21:21.490
Azusa!

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.903
I'm not at work right now,
so it's okay if I'm not cool, right?

00:21:28.028 --> 00:21:29.300
Yup.

00:21:31.111 --> 00:21:33.673
Happy face...

00:21:35.463 --> 00:21:37.206
I'm sorry.

00:21:37.206 --> 00:21:39.566
Have I been making you feel lonely?

00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:43.171
No, not at all.

00:21:44.327 --> 00:21:51.023
Because Terzetto is working so hard, and everyone
who loves you has been eagerly waiting for you.

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:05.959
You know, I really love you as an idol.

00:22:07.489 --> 00:22:09.771
That version of you is so cool.

00:22:09.771 --> 00:22:12.472
Just hearing your voice makes me happy.

00:22:13.217 --> 00:22:15.256
But...

00:22:15.256 --> 00:22:22.131
Between the idol Azusa and I as a fan,
we can't look at each other directly.

00:22:24.753 --> 00:22:31.148
But when we're together like this,
you always look at me.

00:22:35.643 --> 00:22:46.833
So, even if it's just for that moment,
I love having your gaze all to myself.

00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:04.561
Don't go back to being an idol just yet.

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:13.738
I know I can't have the idol Azusa all to myself.

00:23:14.675 --> 00:23:18.994
So, I just want him to be with me
for a little while.

00:23:21.706 --> 00:23:23.592
Hey.

00:23:23.592 --> 00:23:29.487
Does that mean I can do things
that the idol version of me wouldn't do?

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.805
Huh?

00:23:32.805 --> 00:23:34.781
What are you...

00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:40.148
Just a little bit longer.

00:23:50.729 --> 00:23:52.157
Exclusive?
[Terzetto exclusive? The heated battle for MVP!]

00:23:52.157 --> 00:23:54.424
The prize for the MVP sports festival is
[Terzetto exclusive? The heated battle for MVP!]

00:23:54.424 --> 00:23:57.403
the chance to have Terzetto to yourself for a day.
[Terzetto exclusive? The heated battle for MVP!]

00:23:57.403 --> 00:24:00.746
I want you for myself, even if you'd hate me.
[Does Yamato also like Matsuri?]

00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:05.080
- I won't let you have her.
- Azusa, just be there as an idol.
