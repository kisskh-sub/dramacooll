Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.480
I’m really sorry, Alys.

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:38.105
I’m here now.

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:39.482
I’m already here, see?

00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:42.402
You don’t understand.

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.113
I’m done.

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.783
I heard you and Drake broke up.

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.995
I’m so sorry to hear…for you.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.372
Definitely happy for me.

00:00:55.207 --> 00:00:58.210
Aunt, Daddy, don’t tell me…

00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:04.257
Oh my gosh, it’s in
19th floor, too.

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:07.606
I really insisted that
Cy should buy you this unit.

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:11.723
Lord, I knew it. Be careful what
you wish for ‘cause you just might get it.

00:01:18.355 --> 00:01:19.355
Alys?

00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:20.941
Will you eat breakfast with me?

00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:22.020
Good morning, Zy!

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:24.819
Tripp!

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.154
What’s your passcode?

00:01:26.404 --> 00:01:27.364
Come on, let’s eat.

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:28.536
Come here,
I’ll whisper it to you.

00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:31.176
What?

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:32.231
1131?

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:34.175
Why did you shout it out?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Ouch.

00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:40.393
Drake…

00:01:40.418 --> 00:01:41.753
I changed my mind.

00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:43.380
I can’t let you hate me.

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:46.091
I’ll make you love me again.

00:02:21.302 --> 00:02:24.240
I know we broke up, but I
feel like kissing you right now.

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:31.318
I feel like kissing you right
now, but I won’t force you.

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:36.271
Lord, is this a test to
see if I’ve moved on?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.115
Because if it is, my standing
might already be failing.

00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:43.943
I won’t kiss you if
you don’t want me to...

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:46.375
or not.

00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:18.934
Lord, did You know already?

00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:21.927
I failed.

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:24.231
Is there a retake?

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.130
What do I do?

00:03:37.744 --> 00:03:39.537
Someone else might slip.

00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:54.927
Here.

00:04:00.642 --> 00:04:02.813
Lord, that was
a fast retake.

00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:05.038
Why are You
testing me like this?

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:06.481
This is too much.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.235
It’s fine, you can use my shirt.

00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:18.572
Tss.

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:31.935
Let’s go.

00:04:37.637 --> 00:04:38.763
Is he really my ex?

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.059
Why does it feel like he’s still
my boyfriend from the way we act?

00:04:46.813 --> 00:04:47.828
Alys!

00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:48.985
Coming.

00:05:36.905 --> 00:05:40.562
I love you, Drake Palma!

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:52.504
It’s almost a month
since I last came here.

00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:54.671
It looks better.

00:05:56.874 --> 00:05:57.875
I like it simpler.

00:06:10.647 --> 00:06:12.148
Is your family mad at me?

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:14.149
Huh?

00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:28.748
Please tell them that I’m sorry.

00:06:36.673 --> 00:06:37.673
No.

00:06:38.538 --> 00:06:40.208
I’ll tell them personally
that I’m sorry.

00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:43.513
No, Drake. That’s over.

00:06:44.912 --> 00:06:46.164
Past is past, right?

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.042
I know.

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:50.637
- I know, but?
- But...

00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:54.399
It’s over, Drake.

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:57.610
The damage has been done.

00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:02.615
Even if you’re sorry,
you already did it.

00:07:03.904 --> 00:07:05.531
So let’s just leave it, okay?

00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:09.488
And besides, a lot
has changed.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.172
Those things that changed,

00:07:18.047 --> 00:07:19.591
does that include
your feelings, then?

00:07:43.698 --> 00:07:44.698
Drake!

00:07:48.953 --> 00:07:51.331
Um…I’ll just get some water.

00:08:00.798 --> 00:08:02.884
You still haven’t answered
my question, Alys.

00:08:18.691 --> 00:08:19.691
Answer me.

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:21.109
Huh?

00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:22.378
What question?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.149
I said –

00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:25.801
do you still feel the
same way about me,

00:08:26.977 --> 00:08:29.688
or have you forgotten how it
feels like to be in love with me?

00:08:31.346 --> 00:08:32.346
Huh?

00:08:33.498 --> 00:08:36.042
Alys Zyril, I have all
the time in the world.

00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:37.760
Are you gonna answer me or not?

00:08:39.003 --> 00:08:41.881
Uh…it’s just that, Drake…

00:08:42.423 --> 00:08:43.423
What?

00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:52.559
Of course I still love
you, but I’m tired.

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:54.915
Don’t you get it?

00:08:57.063 --> 00:08:59.107
I just want to be honest with you,

00:09:01.272 --> 00:09:02.815
because you deserve honesty.

00:09:06.614 --> 00:09:10.159
I don’t want to hurt you.

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:13.954
Is it Tripp?

00:09:15.373 --> 00:09:16.416
No, Drake.

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:20.044
Tripp and I are just friends.

00:09:22.505 --> 00:09:23.548
Like I told you—

00:09:24.882 --> 00:09:27.677
you’re the one I
still love, okay?

00:09:30.513 --> 00:09:32.135
I just don’t want this anymore.

00:09:34.135 --> 00:09:35.235
The reason, Drake—

00:09:37.437 --> 00:09:38.730
the real reason, Drake—

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:43.943
I got tired of you.

00:09:57.696 --> 00:09:58.696
Oh no, Drake.

00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:05.256
Alys, I’m gonna ask
you one last time.

00:10:06.353 --> 00:10:07.813
Do you still want me or not?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.815
I know that I’m not the most
patient person in the world.

00:10:26.277 --> 00:10:28.780
So Alys, if you don’t want
me anymore, I’ll quit on you.

00:10:35.095 --> 00:10:36.095
Tss.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120
Forget it.

00:10:41.633 --> 00:10:42.633
You know, Alys…

00:10:47.423 --> 00:10:48.424
I really love you.

00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:53.011
But like you,

00:10:55.637 --> 00:10:56.763
I also get tired.

00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:22.083
What have I done?

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.470
Hey.

00:11:59.495 --> 00:12:00.495
Hmm?

00:12:01.289 --> 00:12:04.000
I’ve been talking here for a
while, and you’re not even listening.

00:12:05.877 --> 00:12:09.005
Sorry, I was just thinking.

00:12:10.204 --> 00:12:11.204
About?

00:12:13.468 --> 00:12:14.468
My cousin?

00:12:15.928 --> 00:12:16.928
Yes.

00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:42.329
That took a while, huh?

00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:47.335
Looks like you’ve been replaying
your memories with Drake since day one.

00:12:49.003 --> 00:12:50.171
Stop it.

00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:56.134
You know, Alys,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.972
Drake is one complicated man.

00:13:01.599 --> 00:13:02.683
Even I...

00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:05.767
don’t understand him
most of the time.

00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:09.689
I know.

00:13:11.108 --> 00:13:14.111
I know very well how
complicated Drake is.

00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:17.073
But why is it like that?

00:13:19.116 --> 00:13:21.828
Even if I know how
complicated he is,

00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:25.957
the feeling is still there.

00:13:31.003 --> 00:13:32.463
I still love him so much.

00:13:34.632 --> 00:13:36.551
We dated for months.

00:13:37.593 --> 00:13:43.307
And I know I can’t just
easily forget what we had.

00:13:45.476 --> 00:13:47.395
But then, what’s the
sense of a relationship

00:13:47.395 --> 00:13:49.564
if you can’t even
understand each other, right?

00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:53.192
You knew after all.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:56.570
But what’s your decision?

00:13:58.990 --> 00:13:59.990
Decision about what?

00:14:00.616 --> 00:14:03.255
Alys, Drake is my cousin.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.636
We talk.

00:14:06.882 --> 00:14:08.474
And I know
he wants you back.

00:14:12.003 --> 00:14:13.216
What can you say about that?

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:21.304
I’m tired, and so is he.

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:25.892
So I guess that means
we both have to move on.

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:27.310
Maybe.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.790
Right?

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:30.966
Are you sure about that?

00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:33.416
Maybe this is right.

00:14:35.776 --> 00:14:39.488
Like they say, “if it’s
meant to be, it will be.”

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.702
Maybe it’s better not to force
something that’s not meant to happen.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.170
Let’s go.

00:14:56.172 --> 00:14:57.172
Let’s go where?

00:14:58.341 --> 00:14:59.926
You’ll see. Stand up.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.511
Where exactly?

00:15:07.183 --> 00:15:08.309
You trust me, right?

00:15:10.436 --> 00:15:11.436
Let’s go.

00:15:23.774 --> 00:15:25.920
Tripp, why are we even here?

00:15:26.786 --> 00:15:27.762
Come on.

00:15:27.787 --> 00:15:28.913
You’re so mean.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.389
Zyril, let’s go, hurry!

00:15:30.414 --> 00:15:32.166
Why won’t you just tell me?

00:15:32.191 --> 00:15:33.113
Just say it.

00:15:33.138 --> 00:15:34.889
Trust me on this, alright?

00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:37.933
You’re so annoying.

00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:43.537
Tripp, what kind
of trip is this, hmm?

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.068
Didn’t you say
you’re tired of Drake?

00:15:48.265 --> 00:15:48.991
So?

00:15:49.016 --> 00:15:50.521
What does that
have to do with this?

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:53.295
Since you’re tired of Drake,

00:15:54.362 --> 00:15:55.362
I can start courting you.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.990
Tripp!

00:16:05.787 --> 00:16:06.787
Hey!

00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:08.357
Hey, you, Tripp!

00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:09.998
You’re really talking nonsense!

00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:14.724
Oh no, Drake’s here.

00:16:17.789 --> 00:16:21.709
Lord, what’s happening?
My God!

00:16:22.108 --> 00:16:24.610
St. Collette, I know I’ve
been a bad best friend to Aya,

00:16:24.642 --> 00:16:27.834
but why are you
punishing me like this?

00:16:28.597 --> 00:16:29.597
Drake.

00:16:35.521 --> 00:16:36.647
I’m going to court Alys.

00:16:38.357 --> 00:16:39.525
That’s fine with you, right?

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:42.569
You like her?

00:16:43.446 --> 00:16:45.781
Good luck.
She likes breaking hearts.

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:51.349
Maybe she won’t break mine.

00:16:57.877 --> 00:16:58.877
Alys...

00:17:03.382 --> 00:17:06.385
Don’t mind him, okay?

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:09.179
Come on.

00:17:10.806 --> 00:17:11.806
Let’s go.

00:17:12.224 --> 00:17:13.224
Don’t mind him.

00:17:14.018 --> 00:17:15.519
“She likes breaking hearts.”

00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:19.648
Wow. Is it me?
Me, of all people?

00:17:20.608 --> 00:17:21.615
Don’t mind him.

00:17:23.027 --> 00:17:24.027
Come on.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320
Me?

00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:26.322
Let’s just go.

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:32.869
Zy...

00:17:43.314 --> 00:17:44.314
Are you okay?

00:17:45.758 --> 00:17:46.758
Why?

00:17:47.093 --> 00:17:48.177
What does he even know?

00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:51.680
Does he know how many
times he’s made me cry?

00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:54.266
He doesn’t even have a clue.

00:17:59.897 --> 00:18:00.897
Here.

00:18:01.649 --> 00:18:02.649
Here.

00:18:04.075 --> 00:18:05.445
You’ve been crying nonstop,

00:18:05.489 --> 00:18:06.846
I thought you said you
were tired of Drake?

00:18:08.405 --> 00:18:09.840
Then why are you still crying?

00:18:15.496 --> 00:18:16.528
I don’t even know.

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:26.006
The truth is, I’m hurt because
the person I love is mad at me.

00:18:27.007 --> 00:18:29.969
But of course, it’s not
like I can tell that to Tripp.

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:42.097
Zyril, don’t cry over
him anymore, okay?

00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:50.364
I’m already here.

00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:02.167
You’re right.

00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:03.919
I don’t know anymore.

00:19:05.171 --> 00:19:06.505
But thanks, Tripp.

00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:10.091
It’s nothing.

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:13.971
So, you want to eat something?

00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:16.063
My treat.

00:19:17.224 --> 00:19:19.059
Really? Your treat?

00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:21.036
Yes.

00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:22.133
Why are you surprised?

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.832
Because you rarely treat anyone.

00:19:24.857 --> 00:19:25.941
You’re such a cheapskate.

00:19:26.609 --> 00:19:27.625
Really?

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:28.734
For real.

00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:30.946
Don’t you want it?

00:19:31.482 --> 00:19:32.483
No, I do.

00:19:33.157 --> 00:19:35.409
Wow, Tripp’s treating me.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.461
There.

00:19:37.663 --> 00:19:39.415
You finally smiled.

00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:41.735
Wow, so all it
takes is a treat.

00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:43.641
You’re so cheap.

00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:44.393
Oh.

00:19:44.418 --> 00:19:45.711
Hey, how dare you!

00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:48.756
Who wouldn’t be happy
when you’re stingy?

00:19:48.797 --> 00:19:49.548
You rarely treat anyone.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.107
Wow!

00:19:50.132 --> 00:19:52.426
“Zyril, get me this!”
“Zyril, get me that!”

00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:57.514
Well, don’t cry anymore.

00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:00.235
Let’s wipe your tears.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.436
- There’s still some tears here.
- There’s nothing.

00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:03.560
There’s nothing.
It’s just eye gunk now.

00:20:03.584 --> 00:20:05.024
There’s still some. Right there.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.524
Sigh.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:10.758
How many times have you
cried this month already?

00:20:11.565 --> 00:20:12.945
Haven’t you reached
your quota yet?

00:20:13.322 --> 00:20:14.907
Gosh, I already went over.

00:20:16.637 --> 00:20:18.347
I can’t blame Drake.

00:20:18.994 --> 00:20:20.610
Maybe that’s just how I am.

00:20:23.374 --> 00:20:26.781
What now, Zy? My treat has
a deadline, you know.

00:20:27.015 --> 00:20:28.057
Fine.

00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:34.026
Seriously, Tripp?

00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:36.512
It’s hot outside and
you still want coffee?

00:20:36.845 --> 00:20:38.264
Right, Tripp?

00:20:38.656 --> 00:20:39.699
Don’t you want it?

00:20:39.807 --> 00:20:41.117
They’ve got cold drinks.

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:43.336
Well, you’re right.

00:20:44.228 --> 00:20:45.229
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

00:20:45.229 --> 00:20:46.772
- Good afternoon.
- What can I get for you?

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:48.499
Uhm...

00:20:48.524 --> 00:20:49.977
How about you?
What’s your order?

00:20:51.068 --> 00:20:52.063
- Hey...
- Hmm.

00:20:52.152 --> 00:20:55.114
I rarely treat. So if I were
you, I’d make the most of it.

00:20:55.614 --> 00:20:56.548
For sure.

00:20:56.573 --> 00:20:59.326
Miss, what’s your most
expensive food item?

00:20:59.327 --> 00:21:20.245

You can check down here.

00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:02.346
Okay, I will.

00:21:02.371 --> 00:21:04.848
You said make the
most of it, so I will.

00:21:04.873 --> 00:21:07.063
This might be the last time
because of your stinginess.

00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:10.212
Geez, I just wanted
to make you happy.

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:11.855
Really?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.092
So I have to be sad
so you’ll always treat me?

00:21:15.117 --> 00:21:16.117
Wow!

00:21:17.271 --> 00:21:19.484
Miss, one strawberry shortcake,

00:21:19.638 --> 00:21:21.140
and a large strawberry
frappe, please.

00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:22.032
Okay.

00:21:22.057 --> 00:21:22.683
And then…

00:21:22.683 --> 00:21:24.601
Hey, that’s enough! You’re
getting way too much!

00:21:24.643 --> 00:21:25.811
You told me to make
the most of it, right?

00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:26.578
Fine, go ahead.

00:21:26.603 --> 00:21:27.855
- Order what you want.
- Alright.

00:21:27.855 --> 00:21:29.498
And then this one,
and this one, too.

00:21:29.523 --> 00:21:30.124
Okay.

00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:31.400
- Thank you!
- Welcome, ma’am.

00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:32.501
Thank you.

00:21:32.526 --> 00:21:34.367
Why didn’t you order anything?

00:21:34.528 --> 00:21:39.366
Are you full, or are you holding back
since I went all out with expensive orders?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.250
I’m already full…

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:43.813
just by looking at you.

00:21:45.205 --> 00:21:47.583
There you go again
with your pick-up lines.

00:21:47.916 --> 00:21:51.664
No, I’m still thinking about
what to get, but I’ll order.

00:21:51.837 --> 00:21:52.867
Tripp!

00:21:53.547 --> 00:21:56.050
Oh, why do you look so
surprised to see me?

00:21:57.384 --> 00:22:01.388
Who wouldn’t be surprised
seeing a walking octopus?

00:22:02.348 --> 00:22:04.808
Oh, you’re also here, Alys.

00:22:05.434 --> 00:22:06.438
Obviously.

00:22:08.343 --> 00:22:12.243
Gosh, maybe Shaira has
a secret crush on Tripp.

00:22:12.858 --> 00:22:13.938
I can feel it.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.379
Tripp, why don’t you join us?
Like old times.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.344
Uh, I’ll pass.

00:22:25.287 --> 00:22:28.223
But why? It’s been so long
since we bonded.

00:22:28.248 --> 00:22:30.070
I’ll pass for now.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.252
Come on, please?

00:22:32.878 --> 00:22:34.000
For old times’ sake.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.110
Um, maybe next time, Shai.

00:22:40.135 --> 00:22:41.428
Alys and I have somewhere to go.

00:22:41.762 --> 00:22:43.406
Yes, we need to go somewhere.

00:22:47.184 --> 00:22:48.391
- Drake.
- Drake!

00:22:49.436 --> 00:22:50.956
They don’t want to come with us.

00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:52.516
Let’s just go?

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:55.000
Wait!

00:22:55.444 --> 00:22:56.834
We’ll just join you.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.530
I forgot, we already ordered
but it hasn’t arrived yet.

00:22:59.593 --> 00:23:00.656
Right, Tripp?

00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:04.718
Oh, yes.

00:23:04.743 --> 00:23:06.336
Where are you seated, Shai?

00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:07.914
Over there. Let’s go!

00:23:11.779 --> 00:23:12.779
Shall we?

00:23:24.471 --> 00:23:26.265
How about Sir Cruz,
do you still remember him?

00:23:26.348 --> 00:23:27.516
The long-haired teacher?

Yeah!

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.768
Who’s balding now?

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.313
I saw him last time.

00:23:32.187 --> 00:23:33.266
No way!

00:23:33.397 --> 00:23:35.487
- He’s still at Brenford High?
- Yeah.

00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:37.209
Oh, my gosh!

00:23:37.483 --> 00:23:40.170
What was I thinking,
joining them here?

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:43.131
Their topic is making
me feel out of place.

00:23:43.157 --> 00:23:47.602
Anyway, remember, he’d do
recitations, and if you got it right,

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.805
he’d give you candy
from Thailand?

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.266
Yes, that’s right.

00:23:51.748 --> 00:23:54.084
What was our favorite
flavor again, Drake?

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.860
- Taro.
- Taro?

00:23:58.547 --> 00:24:01.091
Maybe Shaira really is
a better match for Drake.

00:24:02.092 --> 00:24:04.526
They definitely have similarities.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.430
Are you okay?

00:24:10.058 --> 00:24:11.058
Of course, I’m fine.

00:24:13.228 --> 00:24:16.415
Oh, by the way, how
was your debut, Alys?

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.958
You didn’t invite me.

00:24:17.983 --> 00:24:19.526
I thought we were friends.

00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:21.319
Huh?

00:24:21.945 --> 00:24:23.614
Well, it was fine.

00:24:23.989 --> 00:24:25.908
Aww, just “fine”?

00:24:26.658 --> 00:24:29.970
Maybe because Drake
didn’t arrive on time, huh?

00:24:30.159 --> 00:24:33.287
I’m sorry. He had to
attend to my needs.

00:24:34.361 --> 00:24:38.120
So he really went to see Shaira,
that’s why he left me on my debut.

00:24:38.795 --> 00:24:41.659
All along, my suspicion
was right.

00:24:42.758 --> 00:24:46.730
Hope everything went well despite
Drake not being there to escort you.

00:24:47.804 --> 00:24:48.839
It’s fine.

00:24:49.723 --> 00:24:50.933
It’s over, anyway.

00:24:52.848 --> 00:24:54.050
There’s nothing we can do.

00:24:54.937 --> 00:24:57.481
And besides, it turned out okay.

00:24:58.298 --> 00:24:59.409
I was happy.

00:25:00.256 --> 00:25:03.636
See? Past is past,
so move on already.

00:25:03.946 --> 00:25:06.990
And am I right, you
and Drake broke up?

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.450
Yes.

00:25:12.055 --> 00:25:13.055
See, Drake?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.416
I told you, we’re really
meant to be.

00:25:16.441 --> 00:25:17.441
Tss.

00:25:19.503 --> 00:25:22.272
Well, anyway, since
you and Drake are done,

00:25:22.297 --> 00:25:23.941
we can be friends now.

00:25:23.966 --> 00:25:24.995
Huh?

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.355
Yeah!

00:25:26.885 --> 00:25:27.972
You know,

00:25:28.136 --> 00:25:30.347
I didn’t like you before because
you were still with Drake,

00:25:30.372 --> 00:25:33.269
but now that you’re not,
we can be friends.

00:25:33.829 --> 00:25:34.955
I’m Shaira Silos.

00:25:35.158 --> 00:25:37.839
And I’m only mean to people who
are a threat to me and my hubby.

00:25:39.606 --> 00:25:41.438
Um, I’m Alys.

00:25:42.829 --> 00:25:45.279
And I’m not a threat
to you and Drake.

00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:50.024
Not anymore.

00:25:50.158 --> 00:25:52.149
Well, that’s great news.

00:25:52.578 --> 00:25:56.227
I don’t really have friends here
aside from Tripp and Drake.

00:25:56.707 --> 00:25:59.710
All the girls hate me since
I’m close to these two Palmas.

00:26:00.794 --> 00:26:02.219
But we’re friends now, okay?

00:26:04.006 --> 00:26:05.006
Okay.

00:26:08.802 --> 00:26:09.829
See, Drake?

00:26:10.512 --> 00:26:12.364
You don’t have to be
so grumpy anymore.

00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:14.032
We can be friends with your ex.

00:26:14.057 --> 00:26:15.057
Tss.

00:26:16.056 --> 00:26:17.415
Are you okay, Alys?

00:26:18.687 --> 00:26:20.337
Of course, I’m fine.

00:26:21.773 --> 00:26:23.900
Are you sure? Look at your
cake, it’s all squished.

00:26:26.945 --> 00:26:27.945
Oh no.

00:26:29.258 --> 00:26:31.157
You’re so cute!

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.596
Oh my gosh!

00:26:34.621 --> 00:26:36.138
Here, you can have my cake.

00:26:36.163 --> 00:26:37.649
I haven’t touched it, anyway.

00:26:37.873 --> 00:26:39.166
Good thing I ordered it.

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:41.001
Thanks, Tripp!

00:26:41.752 --> 00:26:43.258
Of course, anything for you.

00:26:43.837 --> 00:26:45.297
I’m trying to impress you.

00:26:46.089 --> 00:26:47.085
Since I’m courting you.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.430
Oh, you’re such a suck-up!

00:26:48.884 --> 00:26:50.218
Oh my gosh!

00:26:51.011 --> 00:26:52.438
You’re so cute!

00:26:52.463 --> 00:26:54.781
Aren’t they cute, Drake?

00:26:54.806 --> 00:26:58.188
Anyway, I’m having a barbecue
party later. Wanna come?

00:26:58.810 --> 00:26:59.494
Huh?

00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:01.146
It’s just a barbecue party.

00:27:01.647 --> 00:27:03.524
And we can go swimming, too.

00:27:04.722 --> 00:27:05.735
Sure.

00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:10.155
Oh no, why did I say yes?

00:27:10.864 --> 00:27:12.532
Am I becoming a masochist?

00:27:13.241 --> 00:27:15.994
Do I really want to see
Shaira and Drake together?

00:27:16.745 --> 00:27:18.743
Yehey, so exciting!

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.808
Where do you live?

00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:23.001
Antipolo Heights.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:24.524
In Antipolo?

00:27:25.003 --> 00:27:28.118
Yeah. I only stayed in the
condo because of Drake.

00:27:28.507 --> 00:27:31.399
But I really miss my house,
so I’m going home later.

00:27:31.718 --> 00:27:32.805
You’ll come, okay?

00:27:33.762 --> 00:27:37.649
Minus the overacting, being all posh,
and being territorial with Drake,

00:27:38.183 --> 00:27:40.180
Shaira actually seems nice.

00:27:41.478 --> 00:27:44.606
Oh no, sorry, I really don’t
know how to go to Antipolo.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.962
What are you talking about?
Tripp knows my house.

00:27:48.318 --> 00:27:49.571
You’ll fetch her, right?

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:52.305
Fine.

00:27:53.865 --> 00:27:55.717
You’re really grumpy, Tripp.

00:27:55.742 --> 00:27:57.094
Just move on already.

00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:00.806
How many times do I have
to tell you, I don’t like you.

00:28:00.831 --> 00:28:03.188
How am I supposed to forget
when you keep reminding me?

00:28:04.126 --> 00:28:06.587
And besides, you were
just a puppy love.

00:28:07.963 --> 00:28:09.235
Alys is my true love.

00:28:11.842 --> 00:28:13.677
Come on, Zy, let’s
head back to Brenford.

00:28:13.702 --> 00:28:15.554
Bye, Shaira. Bye, Drake.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.932
Don’t forget later, okay?
I’ll be expecting you.

00:28:25.772 --> 00:28:26.982
Are you really okay with this?

00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:30.168
Even if you don’t come,
I’ll just make an excuse.

00:28:30.193 --> 00:28:33.155
It’s fine. I don’t have
plans later, anyway.

00:28:35.866 --> 00:28:40.432
Alys, I know your IQ’s
a little on the edge.

00:28:41.621 --> 00:28:43.498
But don’t lower your pride, too.

00:28:43.643 --> 00:28:45.050
- Wow, you’re really something, huh!
- Ouch!

00:28:45.082 --> 00:28:46.935
- Of course, I know!
- That hurts!

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.807
Whatever, okay? That’s it.

00:28:50.714 --> 00:28:53.143
Oh, Sir is here.
I’m heading in now.

00:28:54.009 --> 00:28:56.845
Later, at my place, okay?
Don’t be late!

00:28:56.845 --> 00:28:58.417
- Bye.
- Don’t make me wait later.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.682
- Thanks for the treat.
- Bye.

00:29:10.647 --> 00:29:14.108
Mom, I’m here at the house,
but I’ll sleep at the condo.

00:29:14.133 --> 00:29:15.659
I’m going out with Tripp.

00:29:19.159 --> 00:29:23.038
Nanny, if Mom looks for
me, tell her I’m with Tripp.

00:29:23.079 --> 00:29:24.206
She knows. Okay?

00:29:24.206 --> 00:29:25.332
Alright.

00:29:28.084 --> 00:29:29.089
Tripp arrived early.

00:29:30.003 --> 00:29:32.339
- Okay, Nanny, I’ll go ahead.
- Okay.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.620
Tripp!

00:29:39.221 --> 00:29:41.389
Drake, what are you doing here?

00:29:42.057 --> 00:29:44.117
I don’t wanna see you
flirting with my cousin.

00:29:44.142 --> 00:29:45.597
Have some decency, Alys.

00:29:46.561 --> 00:29:47.561
Drake!

00:29:49.231 --> 00:29:50.357
Are you mad at me?

00:29:52.952 --> 00:29:53.952
Why would I?

00:29:55.195 --> 00:29:56.696
What makes you think
I’m mad at you?

00:29:58.111 --> 00:30:01.323
Because you haven’t
looked at me all this time.

00:30:05.914 --> 00:30:07.589
Get over yourself, Alys.

00:30:07.999 --> 00:30:09.876
We’re over.
You said it yourself.

00:30:30.564 --> 00:30:32.112
Where’s that Tripp, anyway?

00:30:32.354 --> 00:30:33.378
What time is it?

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:39.026
- Hey, Alys!
- Ahh! Son of a–!

00:30:39.739 --> 00:30:41.283
You get startled too easily.

00:30:41.867 --> 00:30:44.214
Sorry, I went inside already.
Your gate was open.

00:30:44.536 --> 00:30:45.871
So, shall we?

00:30:46.329 --> 00:30:47.511
Are you good?

00:30:47.622 --> 00:30:51.151
My God, what is it
with these Palmas?

00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:52.745
They’re way too hot.

00:30:55.881 --> 00:30:57.299
So, let’s go?

00:30:58.252 --> 00:31:00.796
Okay. Hold on.

00:31:03.552 --> 00:31:04.753
- Ouch!
- What?

00:31:05.557 --> 00:31:06.651
What happened to you?

00:31:06.752 --> 00:31:07.576
Are you okay?

00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:08.935
My leg’s cramped, it went numb.

00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:15.149
This one?

00:31:16.484 --> 00:31:17.484
Here?

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200
This one?

00:31:27.829 --> 00:31:28.829
This one?

00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:32.625
Better?

00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:35.419
Better?

00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:49.141
Hop on.

00:31:49.351 --> 00:31:50.351
Hop on.

00:32:03.007 --> 00:32:04.007
Alys!

00:32:04.032 --> 00:32:05.675
Are you hopping on or
do I have to drag you?

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.426
Hold on.

00:32:06.451 --> 00:32:08.150
- You’re so agitated.
- Ouch.

00:32:08.286 --> 00:32:09.429
Fine, I’m getting on.

00:32:09.454 --> 00:32:10.471
Hop on.

00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:15.518
Ouch.

00:32:15.543 --> 00:32:16.419
Don’t choke me!

00:32:16.444 --> 00:32:18.072
Forget it, just walk.

00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:21.555
- Tripp?
- Mmm?

00:32:22.801 --> 00:32:25.595
Can I ask you about
you and Shaira?

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.365
Huh?

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.225
I said I wanna know
more about Shaira.

00:32:30.634 --> 00:32:31.927
That’s so random.

00:32:32.188 --> 00:32:33.978
Why are you asking me about her?

00:32:34.729 --> 00:32:36.658
Nothing. I’m just curious.

00:32:38.108 --> 00:32:39.626
What else do you want to know?

00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:41.528
Didn’t I tell you I
courted her before?

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:43.505
So what?

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.619
What else happened?

00:32:45.323 --> 00:32:46.525
You’re so nosy!

00:32:46.783 --> 00:32:47.908
Do you know that?

00:32:48.368 --> 00:32:50.736
You’re so grumpy!
I’m just asking.

00:32:52.248 --> 00:32:53.416
Here, get off for a second.

00:32:58.378 --> 00:32:59.408
What else?

00:33:00.422 --> 00:33:02.757
This is annoying. I don’t want to think
about it, and you keep bringing it up.

00:33:03.675 --> 00:33:04.675
But why?

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.887
Do you still love Shaira,
that’s why you’re hurting?

00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:14.744
You know what, Zyril Perez,

00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:19.150
Shaira dumped me
ages ago. That’s over.

00:33:20.025 --> 00:33:21.291
And at someone this handsome?

00:33:21.818 --> 00:33:24.529
Do you think I would sulk
that long for something like that?

00:33:25.447 --> 00:33:27.799
So what, that’s it?

00:33:27.824 --> 00:33:29.284
You didn’t even
take her seriously.

00:33:29.284 --> 00:33:31.111
- You really are such a playboy!
- Ouch.

00:33:32.169 --> 00:33:34.353
Would I still be a playboy if you’re
the only one I’m serious about?

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.267
Come on, hop on.

00:33:38.526 --> 00:33:39.526
Hurry up!

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.626
Ugh.

00:33:40.736 --> 00:33:41.736
Hold on.

00:34:17.791 --> 00:34:18.791
Let’s go.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Go, hubby.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:49.506
Wow. You’re so good
in swimming, my hubby.

00:34:49.531 --> 00:34:51.672
Drakey, are you having fun?

00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:05.671
Gosh.

00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:11.194
- Tripp…
- What?

00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:14.219
Should I have brought…
two-piece?

00:35:14.926 --> 00:35:17.688
I didn’t know we were
supposed to have a swimming attire.

00:35:18.184 --> 00:35:20.751
Yes. Didn’t Shaira say
we’ll go swimming?

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.606
Oh no, I’ll just go home!

00:35:24.315 --> 00:35:25.344
Hey, Zy, wait!

00:35:25.664 --> 00:35:27.915
Your outfit is fine. That will do.
It looks nice.

00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:30.587
Really? But how do
I go home like this?

00:35:31.114 --> 00:35:33.024
I can’t just head
home soaking wet, right?

00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:38.446
Hold on, I’ve got
an extra shirt here.

00:35:39.225 --> 00:35:40.476
Here.

00:35:41.291 --> 00:35:42.542
Wear this.

00:35:42.981 --> 00:35:44.290
Just wear this when
you go home.

00:35:45.044 --> 00:35:46.212
- Okay, fine.
- Good evening, Sir Tripp.

00:35:46.518 --> 00:35:47.936
Oh, good evening.

00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:50.167
Thank you.

00:35:51.092 --> 00:35:53.153
Hey, Tripp! Feeling
right at home!

00:35:53.178 --> 00:35:54.337
At least pretend to be shy.

00:35:54.762 --> 00:35:56.472
Come on, it’s fine.
No big deal.

00:35:59.851 --> 00:36:00.851
Go on, get changed.

00:36:15.329 --> 00:36:16.357
Tripp?

00:36:17.869 --> 00:36:18.869
Yes?

00:36:18.894 --> 00:36:20.368
Is Shaira an only child?

00:36:22.207 --> 00:36:26.377
She was supposed to have a
sibling, but it was a miscarriage.

00:36:26.878 --> 00:36:28.296
So, Shai is an only child.

00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:33.298
You know what, she’s nice.
Promise.

00:36:35.136 --> 00:36:37.243
Just a little bratty sometimes.

00:36:40.683 --> 00:36:42.560
Anyway, go get changed.

00:36:43.811 --> 00:36:44.938
Go in, then turn right.

00:36:45.605 --> 00:36:46.689
- Okay!
- Go on.

00:36:47.106 --> 00:36:48.228
Fine!

00:36:48.274 --> 00:36:50.109
- Alright, I’m going!
- Turn on the light.

00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:51.439
Got it!

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.200
Tripp.

00:37:12.298 --> 00:37:13.298
Why?

00:37:16.135 --> 00:37:17.135
Come here.

00:37:28.982 --> 00:37:29.982
Thanks, Zyril.

00:37:31.818 --> 00:37:35.697
It’s always been my dream to
have the girl I like wear my shirt.

00:37:39.367 --> 00:37:40.367
Cheesy, right?

00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:42.369
Cheesy, huh?

00:37:43.204 --> 00:37:44.204
I’m sorry.

00:37:46.124 --> 00:37:47.124
It’s fine.

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:50.420
I’m used to your cheesiness
and your life drama.

00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:54.788
You’re ruining the moment.

00:37:59.535 --> 00:38:01.489
Fine. I’ll get changed, too.

00:38:01.514 --> 00:38:02.514
I’ll just change.

00:38:02.974 --> 00:38:03.825
Hurry up.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:04.850
Mmm, okay.

00:38:24.787 --> 00:38:26.069
Hey, Alys!

00:38:26.372 --> 00:38:27.932
Hello, Shaira!

00:38:27.957 --> 00:38:30.054
Hey, I know that shirt.

00:38:30.293 --> 00:38:31.554
That’s Tripp’s, right?

00:38:31.984 --> 00:38:35.571
Yes. I forgot to
bring swimwear.

00:38:36.493 --> 00:38:37.444
OMG!

00:38:37.469 --> 00:38:39.593
You two are so perfect together!

00:38:39.763 --> 00:38:41.967
And for letting
you wear his shirt.

00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:50.453
Where's my towel?

00:38:50.772 --> 00:38:52.491
It’s over there.
I’ll get it for you.

00:39:12.498 --> 00:39:15.655
You know, it’s better
you see them like this.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:22.882
Maybe now you’ll realize
he’s for someone else.

00:39:24.055 --> 00:39:25.171
And you…

00:39:28.476 --> 00:39:29.602
are meant for me.

00:39:35.108 --> 00:39:36.140
You know,

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.522
you shouldn’t be serious.
It doesn’t suit you.

00:39:40.232 --> 00:39:42.401
The one time I get
serious, you’ll just laugh at me.

00:39:42.426 --> 00:39:43.804
You’re really something, huh?

00:39:44.575 --> 00:39:46.882
Sorry, it was just funny.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.621
Sorry, I’ll stop.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:51.835
Are you going to swim?

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.650
If you are, go ahead.
I’ll just stay here.

00:39:56.462 --> 00:39:58.423
Why? Are you not
going to swim?

00:39:58.972 --> 00:39:59.972
I don’t want to anymore.

00:40:01.141 --> 00:40:03.382
So if you’re swimming,
go ahead. I’ll just stay here.

00:40:05.037 --> 00:40:06.037
Okay.

00:40:13.062 --> 00:40:14.062
Tripp...

00:40:14.814 --> 00:40:16.968
whatever it is you’re thinking,

00:40:17.066 --> 00:40:20.007
whatever it is you’re planning,
don’t do it.

00:40:20.611 --> 00:40:22.108
Tripp...Tripp!

00:40:22.488 --> 00:40:24.490
Tripp, I’m warning you!

00:40:24.532 --> 00:40:25.675
Hey, Tripp!

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.509
Tripp, I said –

00:40:26.534 --> 00:40:27.960
Ahh!

00:40:34.584 --> 00:40:36.218
Ugh, you’re so annoying!

00:40:36.502 --> 00:40:38.421
- You’re the worst!
- Ma’am, phone for you.

00:40:38.446 --> 00:40:40.257
Your dad wants to talk to you.

00:40:40.282 --> 00:40:41.399
Oh, I forgot my phone.

00:40:41.424 --> 00:40:43.811
I’ll just talk to my Dad
real quick, I’ll be back.

00:40:45.052 --> 00:40:47.132
You’re really mean!

00:40:51.308 --> 00:40:53.499
Zy, wait, someone’s calling.
I’ll be back for you.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:56.999
Hello?

00:40:57.398 --> 00:40:58.398
Hello?

00:41:20.755 --> 00:41:22.006
Tripp is so annoying.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.163
Where can I get a towel?

00:41:25.801 --> 00:41:27.470
Well, maybe he brought a towel.

00:41:29.096 --> 00:41:30.281
Drake!

00:41:30.306 --> 00:41:31.766
Hey, what are you doing?

00:41:33.893 --> 00:41:34.893
Drake!

00:41:34.894 --> 00:41:36.741
What is your problem?

00:41:39.815 --> 00:41:41.792
You told me that you
don’t like me anymore.

00:41:41.817 --> 00:41:43.336
So I’m trying to forget you.

00:41:43.361 --> 00:41:45.571
But why are you making
it so damn impossible?

00:41:46.113 --> 00:41:47.257
- No –
- Shut up!

00:41:52.505 --> 00:41:53.505
Drake?

00:41:54.976 --> 00:41:56.390
Drake?

00:41:57.983 --> 00:41:58.983
Hubby?

00:41:59.415 --> 00:42:00.415
- It’s Shai–
- Shut up!

00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:01.852
But Shaira...

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.882
What’s this?

00:42:46.257 --> 00:42:47.341
My phone, obviously.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.804
I know, of course.

00:42:51.603 --> 00:42:53.929
But it’s the first time
you’ve given me your phone.

00:42:53.954 --> 00:42:55.390
What am I supposed
to do with it?

00:43:12.283 --> 00:43:15.233
Your brother’s been sending me a
lot of nonsense since we broke up.

00:43:16.542 --> 00:43:18.381
Could you please tell
him to shut the hell up?

00:43:18.706 --> 00:43:20.452
Because he’s slowly
getting into my nerves.

00:43:24.754 --> 00:43:26.047
Oh, Dane.

00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:30.233
He’s really got my back.

00:43:33.679 --> 00:43:34.694
Here.

00:43:34.805 --> 00:43:37.224
I’ll talk to him.

00:43:38.184 --> 00:43:39.343
Sorry about that.

00:43:41.687 --> 00:43:42.687
Alys.

00:43:46.317 --> 00:43:47.796
Drake, what do you want?

00:43:52.531 --> 00:43:53.531
Alys…

00:43:54.617 --> 00:43:56.369
I thought that being mad at you

00:43:57.453 --> 00:43:58.746
would make me forget about you.

00:44:00.562 --> 00:44:02.374
But why is that every
time I see you,

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.804
all I remember is that
I love you?

00:44:14.261 --> 00:44:16.347
Drake, what are you doing?

00:44:18.259 --> 00:44:20.052
We broke up, didn’t we?

00:44:22.853 --> 00:44:24.733
We broke up, right?

00:44:25.022 --> 00:44:26.774
Tripp’s courting me now.

00:44:26.799 --> 00:44:29.968
You’re good with
Shaira, but why this?

00:44:29.993 --> 00:44:31.132
Alys!

00:44:35.825 --> 00:44:38.411
Let me go. Drake, please.

00:44:38.452 --> 00:44:39.390
Alys…

00:44:39.704 --> 00:44:41.304
Let me go.

00:44:42.081 --> 00:44:44.116
- Alys…
- Let me go.

00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:46.794
Let me go.

00:44:54.677 --> 00:44:55.677
Alys…

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.233
I know I’m not the best
boyfriend in the world.

00:45:04.311 --> 00:45:05.616
Maybe I’m the worst.

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:08.769
But I love you so much, Alys.

00:45:10.151 --> 00:45:13.538
I’m so stupid for letting you go.

00:45:16.077 --> 00:45:17.765
Please take me back, Alys.

00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:23.593
I love you so much.
I lay myself bare here.

00:45:26.801 --> 00:45:27.801
Please, come back.

00:45:29.948 --> 00:45:31.199
Take me again, Alys.

00:45:36.032 --> 00:45:41.037
Drake…we’re fine now, aren’t we?

00:45:41.937 --> 00:45:43.355
We’re fine now, right?

00:45:45.186 --> 00:45:48.272
We’ve always been like this.

00:45:49.732 --> 00:45:53.616
We don’t talk, we
ignore each other.

00:45:56.646 --> 00:46:01.491
Even before I presented to be your
girlfriend, we were already like this.

00:46:05.831 --> 00:46:10.851
Can’t you just think
we never happened?

00:46:20.439 --> 00:46:21.439
Alys…

00:46:27.686 --> 00:46:28.897
When I hear your name,

00:46:31.524 --> 00:46:33.275
I remember that I love you.

00:46:35.528 --> 00:46:36.779
When I see your face,

00:46:38.781 --> 00:46:40.366
I remember how much I love you.

00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:43.828
When I kiss your lips,

00:46:44.956 --> 00:46:47.167
I realize that I couldn’t
live without you.

00:47:00.826 --> 00:47:02.584
Alys, let’s get back together.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:06.850
Please.

00:47:09.913 --> 00:47:12.976
Drake, you know
I love you so much, right?

00:47:20.705 --> 00:47:22.498
Don’t you know that
I love you?

00:47:26.537 --> 00:47:27.997
Because you’re
always hurting me.

00:47:28.706 --> 00:47:30.791
I’m confused if you
really love me or not.

00:47:43.721 --> 00:47:44.721
Drake,

00:47:47.187 --> 00:47:48.757
I love you so much.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.813
[In French] Only you.

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:57.726
But now, there’s
Tripp and Shaira.

00:47:58.652 --> 00:47:59.671
So?

00:47:59.696 --> 00:48:00.800
What do you mean “so”?

00:48:02.364 --> 00:48:04.358
There are others
we’ll end up hurting.

00:48:07.202 --> 00:48:08.710
Would you rather hurt me, then?

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:11.254
No.

00:48:11.957 --> 00:48:12.957
No, Drake.

00:48:14.251 --> 00:48:15.294
It’s not like that.

00:48:16.045 --> 00:48:17.726
I don’t want anyone to get hurt.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:21.366
I’d rather get hurt than you.

00:48:23.952 --> 00:48:25.929
Why do you care too much, Alys?

00:48:26.204 --> 00:48:29.291
If you really love me, I
sure as hell love you back.

00:48:31.352 --> 00:48:33.335
Why do complicate
things, Miss Perez?

00:48:35.689 --> 00:48:38.067
That’s just how
it is, Mr. Palma.

00:48:39.526 --> 00:48:42.054
We’re not the only ones
involved here anymore.

00:48:43.656 --> 00:48:45.444
Is it not because
I’m always hurting you?

00:48:47.868 --> 00:48:48.868
No.

00:48:50.537 --> 00:48:52.468
Believe it or not, I’m used to it.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.835
I’ve been through the worst
when I was with you.

00:49:05.479 --> 00:49:07.249
But that’s not the
reason anymore.

00:49:09.264 --> 00:49:11.593
There’s Tripp and Shaira.

00:49:17.065 --> 00:49:18.201
Do you like my cousin?

00:49:22.653 --> 00:49:23.821
What’s not to like?

00:49:24.613 --> 00:49:25.864
He’s a pain in the ass.

00:49:27.449 --> 00:49:29.561
Well, it takes one to know one.

00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:31.911
Touché.

00:49:36.542 --> 00:49:39.044
You’re getting smarter
and smarter, Alys.

00:49:40.587 --> 00:49:42.339
But you’re always
going to be my noob.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:45.991
Can you not call me that?

00:49:48.595 --> 00:49:50.913
Tripp’s looking for me.
I’m leaving.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.640
Wait.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.060
What?

00:49:57.312 --> 00:50:00.968
If you don’t want anybody
to get hurt, date me again.

00:50:03.813 --> 00:50:04.813
What?

00:50:06.155 --> 00:50:07.531
Date me again, Alys.

00:50:08.365 --> 00:50:10.075
Secretly date me this time.

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:36.522
I’m going to court Alys.

00:50:38.145 --> 00:50:39.396
It’s fine with you, right?

00:50:41.319 --> 00:50:42.335
You like her?

00:50:43.192 --> 00:50:45.757
Good luck.
She likes breaking hearts.

00:50:47.404 --> 00:50:48.569
Maybe she won’t break mine.

00:50:59.625 --> 00:51:01.015
Is she really that serious?

00:51:02.544 --> 00:51:04.366
She’s really letting
my cousin court her?

00:51:06.131 --> 00:51:08.092
Why are you hurting
me this much, Alys?

00:51:29.488 --> 00:51:30.593
Hubby!

00:51:31.281 --> 00:51:32.655
My husband!

00:51:34.278 --> 00:51:35.435
Where are you going?

00:51:36.995 --> 00:51:38.372
Wait, where are we going?

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:40.875
Drake, where are we going?

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.151
Are we going on a date?

00:51:42.793 --> 00:51:44.147
We’re going on a date?

00:51:44.413 --> 00:51:45.915
We’re going on a date!

00:51:54.322 --> 00:51:55.983
Go ahead, I’ll just order.

00:51:56.473 --> 00:51:57.473
Okay.

00:52:02.646 --> 00:52:05.065
And one strawberry shortcake,

00:52:05.065 --> 00:52:07.151
and then a large
strawberries and cream.

00:52:07.176 --> 00:52:08.780
- And then—
- Hey, you’re ordering so much!

00:52:09.027 --> 00:52:10.444
- You said make the most of it.
- You’re abusive.

00:52:10.529 --> 00:52:11.738
- Oh?
- Oh, fine, just order it.

00:52:11.763 --> 00:52:12.472
And this one, too.

00:52:12.497 --> 00:52:13.538
That’s it!

00:52:16.108 --> 00:52:19.116
I don’t know why it hurts
seeing you with him like that.

00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:22.334
Maybe I really love you, Alys.

00:52:22.496 --> 00:52:25.643
Because in my heart,
you’re supposed to be mine.

00:52:25.989 --> 00:52:28.074
It’s my biggest mistake to let you go.

00:52:35.311 --> 00:52:38.824
On the last episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

00:52:38.849 --> 00:52:41.452
Drake, the one I’m
always with at night.

00:52:41.773 --> 00:52:43.022
Are you hiding from me?

00:52:43.478 --> 00:52:44.705
Of course not!

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:47.332
And Tripp, the one I’m
always with in the morning.

00:52:47.357 --> 00:52:49.693
You ignored me
for days after that…

00:52:50.777 --> 00:52:54.061
Wow, you have shifting schedule?

00:52:54.323 --> 00:52:55.390
Are you a nurse?

00:52:56.994 --> 00:52:58.829
Every girl always wants Drake.

00:52:59.795 --> 00:53:02.006
Should I act mean too,
so you’ll want me instead?

00:53:04.291 --> 00:53:05.291
Tripp.

00:53:07.669 --> 00:53:08.669
What?

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.107
Stop going after Alys.

00:53:11.256 --> 00:53:12.382
I love Alys, Drake.

00:53:13.926 --> 00:53:15.010
Just be honest, Zy.

00:53:15.465 --> 00:53:18.476
If you like someone,
then go for him.

00:53:19.146 --> 00:53:21.647
You’re not the same
Drake I knew anymore.

00:53:22.768 --> 00:53:26.438
Alys Zyril Perez,
I’m crazy for you.

00:53:27.105 --> 00:53:28.105
Alys?

00:53:28.857 --> 00:53:30.272
What if Alys leaves me?

00:53:31.526 --> 00:53:33.374
I don’t know if I can handle it.

00:53:38.033 --> 00:53:39.868
I love you, Alys Zyril Perez.

00:53:40.786 --> 00:53:44.936
I love you so much too,
Drake Sebastian Palma.
