"Desire the Series"

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.600
(Episode 11)

00:01:42.807 --> 00:01:43.807
Don't get me wrong.

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:47.078
I just don't want to be with a corpse.

00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:50.615
Getting scammed is bad enough.

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:05.697
I'm fine.

00:02:07.832 --> 00:02:09.667
As long as Mr. Sheng isn't angry,

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.504
I'm fine.

00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:34.691
It's starting.

00:02:34.993 --> 00:02:36.261
What's starting?

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:39.596
The rescue.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.334
How do you know?

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:46.237
Footsteps.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:48.739
Lots of them.

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:51.910
Must be the rescue team.

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:02.454
The collapse is severe.

00:03:04.622 --> 00:03:06.491
They'll need hydraulic rock drills

00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:09.494
and excavation equipment to open the exit.

00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:12.997
You can release high-grade
soothing pheromones,

00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.433
have light totems only high-grades possess,

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:21.940
and strength, hearing
beyond S-class Alphas.

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:27.412
Hua Yong, who the hell are you?

00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:29.414
What do you want?

00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:40.624
Mr. Sheng,

00:03:41.593 --> 00:03:42.593
who I am

00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:44.496
or what I want...

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:45.864
none of that matters.

00:03:46.664 --> 00:03:50.435
What matters is I'd never hurt you,

00:03:51.102 --> 00:03:52.337
and never wanted to lie.

00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:54.139
Never wanted to lie?

00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:58.710
If I had a choice,

00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:01.746
I wouldn't have lied to you at all.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.414
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheng.

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.051
I'm not an Omega.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.261
Then what was all that before?

00:04:17.328 --> 00:04:19.063
It's a pheromone modifier.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.634
X Holdings' latest invention,

00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:24.736
but never released.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.238
It can alter my pheromone nature

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:29.541
to Omega,

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:33.344
but the effect is time is limited.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.281
I missed a dose today

00:04:37.182 --> 00:04:39.417
and overused soothing pheromones,

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:42.754
so it wore off.

00:04:49.994 --> 00:04:50.994
Mr. Sheng,

00:04:52.463 --> 00:04:55.233
I'm sorry for lying,

00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:57.969
but I never meant to hurt you.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.870
I just like you too much, so.

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:01.072
Save the excuses.

00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:04.108
Didn't you say to conserve strength?

00:05:04.742 --> 00:05:06.377
Stop using your soothing pheromones.

00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:08.613
I'm not a traumatized Omega.

00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:17.989
Keep releasing pheromones,

00:05:18.156 --> 00:05:19.958
and you'll die

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:21.611
before the rescue team breaks in.

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:25.830
Don't worry, Mr. Sheng.

00:05:26.631 --> 00:05:27.899
I'm not that fragile.

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:30.835
I survived to pursue you.

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:43.915
Did you wear this shirt clip for me?

00:05:44.148 --> 00:05:45.350
It's beautiful".

00:05:51.322 --> 00:05:52.322
Hurry,

00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:54.192
lift your hips.

00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:57.228
What for?

00:05:58.863 --> 00:05:59.863
I need to use it.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.340
That day

00:06:12.176 --> 00:06:13.378
at X Hotel

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.479
it was you.

00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:17.147
It was me.

00:06:24.622 --> 00:06:25.690
Mr. Sheng,

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:29.227
I like you,

00:06:31.462 --> 00:06:33.131
so I can't stand the thought of you

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.368
with anyone else.

00:06:40.938 --> 00:06:42.340
Can you forgive me

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:44.876
and let me keep pursue you?

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.515
I'm not interested in Alphas.

00:06:51.616 --> 00:06:53.518
Rein in your soothing pheromones.

00:06:57.955 --> 00:06:59.924
But I don't want you to hurt.

00:07:07.598 --> 00:07:08.666
I don't hurt.

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:24.515
I found them!

00:07:25.983 --> 00:07:27.819
I found them!

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:29.786
Are they conscious?

00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:33.491
Where's the medical team?
Get an ambulance here!

00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:37.395
Excuse me, may I borrow this?

00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:41.031
Hurry! Come on!

00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:44.969
How did this happen?

00:07:45.703 --> 00:07:47.472
The ambulance can't get through.

00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:48.806
We'll use a wheelchair first.

00:08:09.127 --> 00:08:10.728
Mr. Sheng is injured too.

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:12.229
Yu,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:14.499
help Mr. Sheng.

00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:21.171
Yes.

00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:50.968
Is anyone there? We need help!

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:52.403
Over here! Help! Hurry!

00:08:52.503 --> 00:08:53.905
Serious injuries first!

00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:56.273
Don't rush.

00:08:56.274 --> 00:08:56.941
Give me a hand here.

00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:57.442
Boss,

00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:59.076
Mr. Sheng hit his head

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.212
and got crushed by a bookshelf.

00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:04.015
Accompany him to the hospital for checks.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.050
Yes.

00:09:17.328 --> 00:09:18.329
Goodbye,

00:09:57.835 --> 00:09:59.237
Mr. Sheng.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.263
Why keep refreshing
Sheng Shaoyou's moments?

00:10:25.897 --> 00:10:27.198
Look at all that blood...

00:10:27.498 --> 00:10:28.699
can't you stay out of trouble?

00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:33.437
I wish I could be in the
same ER as Mr. Sheng.

00:10:33.971 --> 00:10:35.706
You need a shrink.

00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:39.076
Your dependency on Sheng Shaoyou

00:10:39.577 --> 00:10:40.511
is psychotic.

00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:41.511
Oh?

00:10:42.013 --> 00:10:43.013
Really?

00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:46.083
I always worry that I
don't love him enough.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.418
Isn't this enough?

00:10:48.252 --> 00:10:49.086
If you loved him more,

00:10:49.087 --> 00:10:50.354
I'd be annoyed to death.

00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:51.222
By the way,

00:10:51.789 --> 00:10:53.490
that pheromone modifier you used...

00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:55.159
does it interact with anesthetics?

00:10:55.826 --> 00:10:57.094
If you can't be anesthetized,

00:10:57.662 --> 00:10:58.996
how will you undergo surgery?

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.931
The triage said the patient

00:11:00.932 --> 00:11:02.599
was admitted with a
penetrating injury from rebar.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600
Where's the patient.

00:11:06.304 --> 00:11:07.464
Excuse me, where's the rebar.

00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:10.407
I pulled it out.

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:14.578
Doctor, the new ER patient today

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:15.912
with that blood loss

00:11:15.913 --> 00:11:17.515
should at least be comatose.

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:20.318
Is he even normal.

00:11:32.663 --> 00:11:33.731
How long till recovery?

00:11:34.231 --> 00:11:35.933
CT shows a large wound surface

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:37.668
though no vital organs damaged

00:11:38.035 --> 00:11:38.903
improper handling

00:11:38.904 --> 00:11:39.904
caused heavy bleeding

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:41.105
and he needs suturing.

00:11:42.073 --> 00:11:44.008
Are you sure no anesthesia is needed?

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:46.009
Mm.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.821
Let's start.

00:11:57.888 --> 00:11:59.289
Blood oxygen saturation is dropping.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.091
Blood pressure rising.

00:12:00.092 --> 00:12:01.592
Pain may cause shock.

00:12:03.794 --> 00:12:05.462
Patient's SpO2 has fallen
below the warning line.

00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:06.263
Blood pressure too high.

00:12:06.263 --> 00:12:07.098
Prepare oxygen.

00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:08.331
What to do about the high blood pressure.

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:09.133
Treat it?

00:12:09.134 --> 00:12:10.134
Abnormal heart rate.

00:12:10.135 --> 00:12:11.235
Speed up the suturing.

00:12:25.316 --> 00:12:26.316
Mr. Sheng.

00:12:27.652 --> 00:12:28.753
It hurts so much.

00:12:38.596 --> 00:12:39.596
Where's Sheng Shaoyou.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:40.730
Injuries are minor

00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:43.434
mild abrasions on back and forehead

00:12:43.968 --> 00:12:45.036
already treated

00:12:45.102 --> 00:12:46.502
arranged for inpatient observation.

00:12:47.938 --> 00:12:48.938
How's the boss.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.942
No idea, been in there over an hour.

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:53.310
Can't use anesthesia

00:12:53.944 --> 00:12:55.780
signed a bunch of
preoperative risk notices.

00:12:57.014 --> 00:12:58.334
What did the hospital office say?

00:12:58.416 --> 00:12:59.517
Got the notice yet?

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.650
Mm

00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:02.620
Dean Huang said he's coming personally.

00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:03.753
Hua Yong refused.

00:13:04.422 --> 00:13:06.702
Coincidentally, today's
on-duty chief of general surgery.

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.327
Is that the one operating on the boss.

00:13:12.463 --> 00:13:14.632
No, the one who treated
Sheng Shaoyou's abrasions.

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:16.067
Hua Yong said he's fine

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.502
told the ER attending
to just suture casually

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.239
and sent the chief of general
surgery to visit his Mr. Sheng.

00:13:23.374 --> 00:13:25.376
Whenever it's about Sheng Shaoyou,

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.111
he goes crazy.

00:13:27.978 --> 00:13:28.846
Wonder what love potion.

00:13:28.847 --> 00:13:30.548
Sheng Shaoyou gave him.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.917
Wound is sutured,

00:13:33.918 --> 00:13:35.019
but no anesthesia used

00:13:35.152 --> 00:13:36.453
considering heavy blood loss

00:13:36.454 --> 00:13:38.189
and patient weakness,

00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:39.556
we administered sedatives

00:13:39.557 --> 00:13:41.826
but sedatives seem less
effective on the patient

00:13:42.093 --> 00:13:43.593
so when your relatives care for him,

00:13:43.594 --> 00:13:44.595
pay extra attention.

00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:57.066
I need to go back to the company later.

00:13:57.408 --> 00:13:58.743
Take care of Yong here.

00:13:59.276 --> 00:14:00.745
Mm, don't worry

00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:03.114
I'll accompany the boss throughout.

00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:07.218
Unfamiliar doctors are no good.

00:14:07.318 --> 00:14:08.318
Idiots,

00:14:08.986 --> 00:14:10.988
and asking why the caregiver isn't here.

00:14:11.489 --> 00:14:14.091
If this little lunatic had
any family to care for him

00:14:14.658 --> 00:14:16.894
he wouldn't be so obsessed
with Sheng Shaoyou.

00:14:20.397 --> 00:14:22.366
What's so great about Sheng Shaoyou.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.935
Why does Yong like him.

00:14:25.503 --> 00:14:27.343
Went through so much to
pursue him to JIANGHU.

00:14:28.005 --> 00:14:30.541
Just because Sheng Shaoyou
was kind and saved him once.

00:14:33.043 --> 00:14:34.311
The boss has liked Mr. Sheng

00:14:35.012 --> 00:14:36.614
for ages.

00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:39.115
Mm.

00:14:41.752 --> 00:14:42.752
By the way,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.955
keep Yong's injury absolutely confidential.

00:14:45.556 --> 00:14:48.259
If his half-siblings find out

00:14:48.692 --> 00:14:49.894
it'll be trouble.

00:14:50.728 --> 00:14:52.429
Mm, got it.

00:15:08.412 --> 00:15:10.581
Why send messages with an IV in?

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.019
Sorry, Mr. Sheng

00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:17.655
I was wrong, please forgive me.

00:15:18.055 --> 00:15:20.624
Mr. Sheng, don't ignore me.

00:15:20.858 --> 00:15:23.260
Please, my wound hurts so much.

00:15:23.694 --> 00:15:25.696
Painkillers don't seem to work.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.531
Doctor said it's inflamed

00:15:27.798 --> 00:15:29.133
not healing very well

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.468
Mr. Sheng, hospital is so lonely alone

00:15:32.469 --> 00:15:34.104
no visitors.

00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:35.773
What do you mean no visitors.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.540
Aren't I someone.

00:15:39.476 --> 00:15:40.511
No.

00:15:40.744 --> 00:15:43.214
Won't Mr. Sheng come see me.

00:15:45.015 --> 00:15:46.750
Sent so many messages but no reply.

00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:48.751
Didn't you say teach me

00:15:48.752 --> 00:15:49.987
how to pursue someone?

00:15:50.988 --> 00:15:53.490
Hua Yong, is this your demonstration?

00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:56.126
Don't do anything stupid.

00:15:56.894 --> 00:15:59.830
When will Mr. Sheng forgive me.

00:16:00.431 --> 00:16:01.465
How would I know?

00:16:02.132 --> 00:16:04.667
Buddies, today I'm taking you guys to see

00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:07.838
the epic shoddy
construction in JIANGHU City.

00:16:08.272 --> 00:16:09.906
See, can't imagine it, right?

00:16:09.907 --> 00:16:11.608
In the earthquake a few days ago

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:13.610
the only building that
collapsed in the whole city

00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:16.814
was the VIP reading room
of Jinghe District Library.

00:16:17.448 --> 00:16:19.315
This reading room is newly built

00:16:19.316 --> 00:16:21.218
completed just last end of last year

00:16:21.352 --> 00:16:23.653
donated by JIANGHU's famous
biopharmaceutical company.

00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:25.422
SHENGFANG Biotech.

00:16:25.623 --> 00:16:28.492
Heard even the construction team was
designated by SHENGFANG Biotech.

00:16:28.926 --> 00:16:29.894
If you can't afford to donate, then don't.

00:16:29.895 --> 00:16:31.928
Donating shoddy construction
is too irresponsible.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:33.863
It's a contempt for people's lives.

00:16:33.864 --> 00:16:34.898
SHENGFANG Biotech, huh?

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:35.666
I'll remember that.

00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:36.467
Avoid them in the future.

00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:37.368
Must be strictly investigated.

00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:38.534
This isn't a kind donation at all.

00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:39.736
It's attempted murder.

00:16:39.737 --> 00:16:41.471
Is SHENGFANG Biotech a
pharmaceutical company?

00:16:41.472 --> 00:16:43.552
Who would dare use drugs
produced by such a company?

00:16:43.908 --> 00:16:45.742
Great comments, everyone.

00:16:45.743 --> 00:16:46.543
Follow me

00:16:46.544 --> 00:16:48.344
I'll bring you more live broadcasts of

00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:50.180
breaking hot events in the future.

00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:00.057
Who was in charge of this donation?

00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:01.791
The second young master,

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:02.959
Sheng Shaoqing.

00:17:03.327 --> 00:17:04.327
Mm.

00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:07.240
We conducted a comprehensive investigation
immediately after the incident.

00:17:07.264 --> 00:17:08.731
The donor this time

00:17:08.732 --> 00:17:10.767
was a charity fund under the group

00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:12.168
managed by the second young master.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.139
He also fully dominated this donation

00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:18.609
including designating
the construction team.

00:17:20.945 --> 00:17:22.346
How much was donated in total?

00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:25.215
The donation mainly
consisted of three parts

00:17:25.716 --> 00:17:28.184
ten traditional reading rooms

00:17:28.185 --> 00:17:29.954
three digital reading rooms

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.424
and various books which
the price totaling 20 million

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.892
a total of 40 million

00:17:36.493 --> 00:17:37.594
40 million?

00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:41.615
40 million was used to build a pile of junk
that collapses at the first earthquake.

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:44.467
Investigate.

00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:45.536
Find out clearly.

00:17:45.537 --> 00:17:47.470
After finding out, compensate
those who should be compensated

00:17:47.471 --> 00:17:49.271
and send those who
should go to jail to jail.

00:17:49.373 --> 00:17:51.041
Yes, Mr. Sheng, I understand.

00:17:54.278 --> 00:17:56.447
Doctor, how is Mr. Sheng's condition?

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.215
Secretary Chen, don't worry.

00:17:58.315 --> 00:18:00.450
The results of the brain
enhanced CT have come out.

00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:01.584
No major problems.

00:18:01.585 --> 00:18:03.586
Except for abrasions
on the forehead and back

00:18:03.587 --> 00:18:04.987
no other obvious external injuries.

00:18:05.322 --> 00:18:07.190
He can be discharged after
resting for an hour or two.

00:18:07.191 --> 00:18:08.191
Thank you, doctor.

00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:09.826
Doctor.

00:18:10.327 --> 00:18:12.527
And, what about the gentleman
who was admitted with me?

00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:13.864
You mean Mr. Hua?

00:18:14.531 --> 00:18:14.932
Mm.

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:16.843
That gentleman is
incompatible with anesthesia.

00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:18.969
He endured more than two hours of surgery.

00:18:19.136 --> 00:18:20.236
Consumed a lot,

00:18:20.237 --> 00:18:21.597
but should be fine after recovery.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.109
Oh, I see, thank you.

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:26.309
Mm.

00:18:48.098 --> 00:18:50.901
Sorry, Mr. Sheng, I was wrong.

00:18:50.934 --> 00:18:52.069
Please forgive me

00:18:52.302 --> 00:18:54.303
Mr. Sheng, don't ignore me.

00:18:54.304 --> 00:18:56.707
Please, my wound hurts so much.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.708
The painkillers don't seem to work.

00:18:58.709 --> 00:19:00.076
The doctor said it's inflamed.

00:19:00.077 --> 00:19:01.345
Not healing well

00:19:01.412 --> 00:19:02.512
Mr. Sheng

00:19:02.513 --> 00:19:03.513
Mr. Sheng.

00:19:03.714 --> 00:19:05.314
Mr. Hua is in another ward.

00:19:05.315 --> 00:19:06.755
Would you like me to take you there?

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.320
Mm.

00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:11.821
Mm.

00:20:05.976 --> 00:20:07.311
How do you do things?

00:20:07.644 --> 00:20:08.778
Took so much money

00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:10.447
but I haven't seen anything.

00:20:11.715 --> 00:20:13.716
The information you
provided is also inaccurate.

00:20:13.717 --> 00:20:15.152
That night we went to kidnap.

00:20:15.619 --> 00:20:17.154
It wasn't an Omega at all.

00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:18.688
Not an Omega.

00:20:18.822 --> 00:20:20.257
Come on, then tell me what it was.

00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:22.058
It's an S-class Alpha

00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:24.461
I've never seen such terrifying
oppressive pheromones.

00:20:26.063 --> 00:20:27.063
S-class Alpha?

00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:31.435
Do you take me for a fool?

00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:34.704
There wasn't even a Beta
among Sheng Shaoyou's exes.

00:20:34.705 --> 00:20:36.140
You're telling me S-class Alpha.

00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:39.909
Speak up.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.410
I...

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.313
Don't be in a hurry.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.449
As I said last time.

00:20:45.616 --> 00:20:47.718
Just kidnap the target directly.

00:20:48.318 --> 00:20:50.187
Don't look for that evil Omega.

00:20:50.954 --> 00:20:53.423
Sheng Shaoyou is an S-class Alpha.

00:20:53.757 --> 00:20:54.892
Can you two handle it?

00:20:55.092 --> 00:20:56.226
Of course.

00:20:56.426 --> 00:20:58.027
Last time at X Hotel.

00:20:58.028 --> 00:20:59.228
It was wrong information,

00:20:59.229 --> 00:21:00.297
we took it lightly.

00:21:00.464 --> 00:21:02.699
This time we will
definitely get things done.

00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:04.201
But

00:21:04.768 --> 00:21:06.436
the target difficulty has increased.

00:21:06.637 --> 00:21:09.506
The price must double.

00:21:10.307 --> 00:21:12.109
Money is not a fucking problem at all.

00:21:13.944 --> 00:21:17.848
As long as you can cut out
Sheng Shaoyou's glands.

00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:19.749
Not to mention doubling,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.951
tripling is okay.

00:21:23.787 --> 00:21:26.557
Brother, I've actually recovered very well.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.457
The doctor said my
post-operative recovery is very good

00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:29.693
I can be discharged soon.

00:21:30.027 --> 00:21:32.027
You don't have to come
and accompany me every day.

00:21:32.396 --> 00:21:33.197
It's okay.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.731
Your slave-driver boss

00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:36.992
makes you work overtime
even on weekends usually.

00:21:37.267 --> 00:21:39.335
It feels like besides normal work every day

00:21:39.336 --> 00:21:40.970
you either accompany him to events

00:21:40.971 --> 00:21:43.339
or go to his house to organize
his personal belongings.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.342
You suddenly took such a long leave.

00:21:45.542 --> 00:21:46.810
Will he give you a hard time?

00:21:47.144 --> 00:21:49.246
No, don't talk nonsense.

00:21:50.514 --> 00:21:51.915
Mr. Shen is very nice.

00:21:52.249 --> 00:21:53.250
Haven't you met him?

00:21:53.517 --> 00:21:55.619
That's why I'm worried after meeting him.

00:21:55.986 --> 00:21:57.554
He looks unapproachable.

00:21:57.654 --> 00:22:00.057
You were classmates before, which was fine.

00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:01.792
Now you work as his secretary

00:22:01.992 --> 00:22:03.794
and owe him such a big favor.

00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:05.294
With your personality

00:22:05.295 --> 00:22:07.296
you won't refuse no matter
what excessive request he makes,

00:22:07.297 --> 00:22:09.032
right?

00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:10.934
I just work overtime occasionally.

00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:13.804
Don't think so complicated.

00:22:15.138 --> 00:22:16.439
Okay, okay, I know.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.341
It's all because you care about
the company's development

00:22:18.342 --> 00:22:18.909
work hard and take on no complaints,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.950
voluntarily work overtime.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.211
Shen Wenlang is the best boss in the world.

00:22:22.212 --> 00:22:23.212
Are you satisfied?

00:22:29.419 --> 00:22:31.755
I'll go to Qing's ward
to see you right away

00:22:33.357 --> 00:22:36.860
I'll go to see her in Qing's
ward right away, are you there?

00:22:38.695 --> 00:22:40.530
I am, anytime.

00:22:40.864 --> 00:22:42.633
Do you need me to pick you up at the door?

00:22:51.308 --> 00:22:53.610
Mr. Shen, why did you come so quickly?

00:22:53.944 --> 00:22:55.479
Didn't I say come anytime?

00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:03.619
Qing, get well soon.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.388
Thank you

00:23:04.388 --> 00:23:05.388
Mr. Shen.

00:23:05.455 --> 00:23:06.223
Please have a seat.

00:23:06.223 --> 00:23:07.223
No need.

00:23:07.257 --> 00:23:08.892
Hua Yong is hospitalized upstairs.

00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:10.994
I came to see Xiao Qing by the way.

00:23:12.863 --> 00:23:14.140
Secretary Hua is hospitalized upstairs.

00:23:14.164 --> 00:23:15.164
Is he sick?

00:23:15.332 --> 00:23:16.332
Mm.

00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:17.200
Sort of.

00:23:17.367 --> 00:23:18.368
Is it serious?

00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:21.538
How about after I accompany
Qing for the examination

00:23:21.672 --> 00:23:24.206
I also visit Secretary Hua by the way?

00:23:24.207 --> 00:23:25.207
As you like.

00:23:46.797 --> 00:23:47.797
Where's Chang Yu?

00:23:49.466 --> 00:23:50.826
Did Chang Yu go back to Country P?

00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:53.569
Don't bother me

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:54.638
I'm busy now.

00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:55.771
What are you doing?

00:23:56.406 --> 00:23:57.674
Seducing Mr. Sheng.

00:23:58.809 --> 00:23:59.809
Seducing?

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:01.645
I think it's begging.

00:24:02.145 --> 00:24:04.113
Begging him to change his mind soon

00:24:04.114 --> 00:24:05.114
and not ignore you.

00:24:06.783 --> 00:24:07.918
You can see it that way

00:24:09.353 --> 00:24:10.686
I've told you long ago.

00:24:10.687 --> 00:24:11.822
Don't be so greedy.

00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:13.322
Because of you,

00:24:13.323 --> 00:24:15.363
how many times has Sheng
Shaoyou caused me trouble?

00:24:15.692 --> 00:24:17.894
Someone as smooth-talking
and smiling as him

00:24:18.528 --> 00:24:20.130
would block me in the garage for you.

00:24:20.864 --> 00:24:22.299
What more do you want?

00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:25.235
Mr. Sheng has never
liked anyone for a long time.

00:24:25.635 --> 00:24:27.237
He treated his exes

00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:29.806
like treasures when he liked them

00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:31.975
but discarded them like
old shoes when he didn't.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.711
But he's soft-hearted.

00:24:35.612 --> 00:24:37.013
Hates to owe anyone.

00:24:38.415 --> 00:24:39.415
So.

00:24:39.916 --> 00:24:41.618
Only by making him feel he owes me a lot

00:24:42.652 --> 00:24:44.172
thus I can have more bargaining chips.

00:24:45.822 --> 00:24:46.822
Come in.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.460
Mr. Shen.

00:24:52.629 --> 00:24:53.629
Secretary Hua.

00:24:53.897 --> 00:24:55.632
Secretary Gao, long time no see.

00:24:56.366 --> 00:24:57.366
Long time no see.

00:24:57.934 --> 00:25:00.737
Heard Secretary Hua is hospitalized.

00:25:01.338 --> 00:25:03.258
I'm just accompanying
my sister in the hospital.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.674
Came to see you by the way.

00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:06.176
Thank you, Secretary Gao.

00:25:14.351 --> 00:25:16.085
By the way, Secretary Gao.

00:25:16.086 --> 00:25:19.355
Heard Mr. Shen met a fated Omega

00:25:19.356 --> 00:25:20.891
at X Hotel some time ago.

00:25:21.158 --> 00:25:22.526
What fated Omega?

00:25:22.893 --> 00:25:24.326
Can you not say it so disgustingly?

00:25:24.327 --> 00:25:26.430
Did I say something wrong?

00:25:27.431 --> 00:25:28.431
Secretary Hua,

00:25:28.632 --> 00:25:30.966
there was an Omega who
suddenly went into heat

00:25:30.967 --> 00:25:33.167
Mr. Shen was just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:25:34.304 --> 00:25:35.784
In the wrong place at the wrong time?

00:25:36.106 --> 00:25:38.175
Secretary Gao, you still understand him.

00:25:38.308 --> 00:25:40.410
No wonder you've been by
his side for so many years.

00:25:42.445 --> 00:25:45.615
Have you found out who
that Omega is, Secretary Gao?

00:25:48.251 --> 00:25:51.288
Not yet, the hotel
monitor didn't capture it.

00:25:51.822 --> 00:25:52.823
Is that so?

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:54.890
Coincidentally.

00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:56.625
I took a photo of that Omega's back

00:25:56.726 --> 00:25:58.928
that day.

00:25:58.929 --> 00:26:00.730
Really? Let me see.

00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:02.666
It's no use for you.

00:26:02.766 --> 00:26:03.766
What do you mean?

00:26:04.267 --> 00:26:05.769
Only the back, no front face.

00:26:06.136 --> 00:26:09.205
But X Hotel wasn't open
to the public that day.

00:26:09.206 --> 00:26:11.074
There were not many invited guests.

00:26:11.475 --> 00:26:13.243
You should be able to

00:26:13.543 --> 00:26:15.345
narrow down the range by clothing, right?

00:26:15.846 --> 00:26:17.314
If I find out who it is

00:26:17.814 --> 00:26:19.416
he's dead.

00:26:24.254 --> 00:26:25.055
Who?

00:26:25.188 --> 00:26:26.188
Chang Yu.

00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:28.225
Then go out to answer the phone first

00:26:28.325 --> 00:26:29.692
I'll show the photo to Secretary Gao.

00:26:29.693 --> 00:26:31.027
Secretary Gao is so capable.

00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:32.127
Surely you can find out

00:26:32.128 --> 00:26:33.330
who that Omega is soon,

00:26:33.497 --> 00:26:35.098
right, Secretary Gao?

00:26:36.099 --> 00:26:37.600
Then Gao Tu, follow up on this.

00:26:37.601 --> 00:26:38.801
Tell me when you have results.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:40.870
Yes.

00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:09.632
Secretary Hua, listen to my explanation.

00:27:09.633 --> 00:27:10.367
No need,

00:27:10.368 --> 00:27:12.301
What happened between
you and Wenlang that day

00:27:12.302 --> 00:27:14.382
I'm not really interested
in what happened that day.

00:27:20.143 --> 00:27:22.946
But Secretary Gao, you like him, right?

00:27:33.957 --> 00:27:34.957
Where's Gao Tu?

00:27:35.525 --> 00:27:36.126
Gone.

00:27:36.393 --> 00:27:37.727
You just let him go like that?

00:27:38.628 --> 00:27:41.063
What else should I do? Should I keep him

00:27:41.064 --> 00:27:42.909
so you can come back
and take a few more looks?

00:27:42.933 --> 00:27:44.467
Why would I take a few more looks?

00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:46.655
If you don't want to take a few more looks.

00:27:47.103 --> 00:27:49.138
Why did you go out to buy
flowers early in the morning

00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:50.974
and go to see his sister so happily?

00:27:51.575 --> 00:27:53.343
You see each other
every day at the company.

00:27:54.244 --> 00:27:55.244
Isn't that enough?

00:27:55.545 --> 00:27:56.905
We don't see each other every day.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.615
He's been on leave for several days.

00:27:59.416 --> 00:28:01.785
I don't know if he's really
accompanying his sister.

00:28:03.853 --> 00:28:05.956
Wenlang, to be honest.

00:28:06.656 --> 00:28:08.136
Do you have a crush on Secretary Gao?

00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:11.428
Bullshit, did the earthquake
shake your brain?

00:28:12.228 --> 00:28:13.228
No?

00:28:14.364 --> 00:28:16.199
I think your crush is quite obvious.

00:28:16.433 --> 00:28:17.434
How is that possible.

00:28:17.767 --> 00:28:19.035
Hurry up and write your letter.

00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:20.437
Seduce your Sheng Shaoyou.

00:28:30.747 --> 00:28:31.814
Don't get me wrong

00:28:31.815 --> 00:28:33.016
I have no other meaning.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:34.985
Anyway, I only sent the photo to you.

00:28:35.352 --> 00:28:38.221
Whether to show it to
Wenlang or not, it's up to you.

00:28:51.101 --> 00:28:52.101
Hello?

00:28:52.569 --> 00:28:53.569
Where are you?

00:28:54.237 --> 00:28:55.372
I'm on my way home

00:28:55.705 --> 00:28:56.705
Mr. Shen.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.274
Do you have any orders?

00:28:58.908 --> 00:28:59.908
No, nothing.

00:29:00.644 --> 00:29:01.745
Just wanted to ask you.

00:29:01.878 --> 00:29:03.346
How did your chat with Hua Yong?

00:29:04.014 --> 00:29:05.749
Do you know who that Omega is?

00:29:10.887 --> 00:29:11.887
Hello?

00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:13.355
Gao Tu,

00:29:13.656 --> 00:29:14.691
are you listening?

00:29:15.992 --> 00:29:16.992
Mr. Shen.

00:29:18.094 --> 00:29:20.864
The photo Secretary
Hua gave isn't very clear.

00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:23.700
The other person is
wearing a very common suit.

00:29:24.134 --> 00:29:26.269
It's hard to tell from the photo alone

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.571
I'll check with the hotel again tomorrow.

00:29:30.373 --> 00:29:31.373
Okay.

00:29:32.075 --> 00:29:33.075
That

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.070
when are you going to the company?

00:29:35.612 --> 00:29:37.714
My vacation ends today

00:29:37.914 --> 00:29:39.516
I'll be at the company on time tomorrow.

00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:41.016
Okay,

00:29:41.451 --> 00:29:42.451
see you tomorrow.

00:29:42.986 --> 00:29:43.986
See you.

00:30:00.336 --> 00:30:01.336
Come in.

00:30:08.545 --> 00:30:09.545
Mr. Sheng.

00:30:09.646 --> 00:30:11.126
These are the letters sent this week.

00:30:35.305 --> 00:30:37.974
Mr. Sheng, did you eat well today?

00:30:38.308 --> 00:30:40.110
I haven't eaten all day.

00:30:40.243 --> 00:30:41.411
Because I miss you so much.

00:30:48.852 --> 00:30:50.854
Mr. Sheng, are you still angry with me?

00:30:51.121 --> 00:30:52.622
Will you never see me again?

00:30:52.889 --> 00:30:53.990
What should I do?

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.059
I miss you so much thus I'm dying.

00:30:56.259 --> 00:30:57.594
My wound hurts so much.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.162
It would be good if you were here.

00:30:59.863 --> 00:31:00.863
Throw them away.

00:31:02.132 --> 00:31:03.132
Yes.

00:31:14.511 --> 00:31:15.511
Mr. Sheng.

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:17.646
Take them away.

00:31:35.932 --> 00:31:37.267
Sorry, Mr. Sheng.

00:32:35.792 --> 00:32:37.994
Yu, wait for me in the car.

00:32:38.494 --> 00:32:39.494
Yes.

00:32:53.843 --> 00:32:56.045
Why are these garbage still on my desk?

00:32:56.512 --> 00:32:57.746
The letter carrier said

00:32:57.747 --> 00:33:00.116
his boss really wants to pursue you openly.

00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:01.584
If these letters

00:33:01.585 --> 00:33:03.286
don't appear on your desk in time

00:33:03.419 --> 00:33:05.755
his boss will make trends on it

00:33:05.855 --> 00:33:06.990
and be on the front page.

00:33:08.358 --> 00:33:09.358
Mr. Sheng.

00:33:09.525 --> 00:33:11.160
Choose the lesser of two evils.

00:33:11.928 --> 00:33:13.395
Is the letter carrier still there?

00:33:13.396 --> 00:33:14.430
Mm, yes.

00:33:14.864 --> 00:33:16.384
Ask him to wait in the reception room.

00:33:16.499 --> 00:33:17.133
But today.

00:33:17.133 --> 00:33:18.101
Don't talk so much nonsense.

00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:18.968
Let him wait

00:33:18.969 --> 00:33:20.069
I'll go talk to him myself.

00:33:20.803 --> 00:33:21.803
Okay.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.250
Mr. Sheng.

00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:41.823
Today Mr. Hua came to
deliver the letter in person

00:33:41.824 --> 00:33:44.260
I heard from Secretary Chen
that Mr. Sheng wants to see me.

00:33:45.228 --> 00:33:46.629
Has Mr. Sheng forgiven me?

00:33:47.997 --> 00:33:49.931
As long as you and your apology letters

00:33:49.932 --> 00:33:51.234
can disappear forever

00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:52.501
I'll forgive you.

00:33:55.238 --> 00:33:56.238
Hua Yong.

00:33:56.606 --> 00:33:58.474
Don't appear in front of me again.

00:34:00.109 --> 00:34:01.109
Why?

00:34:01.144 --> 00:34:02.545
Because I don't like it.

00:34:03.913 --> 00:34:05.248
Can't you try to like me?

00:34:06.015 --> 00:34:06.516
No.

00:34:06.516 --> 00:34:07.317
Why?

00:34:07.417 --> 00:34:08.417
No reason

00:34:08.618 --> 00:34:09.952
I'm not interested in Alpha.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.021
Then it's okay if it's not an Alpha?

00:34:13.556 --> 00:34:15.223
Are you saying you're not an Alpha

00:34:15.224 --> 00:34:16.326
but a Beta?

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:17.859
Hua Yong.

00:34:18.828 --> 00:34:20.396
Are you going too far?

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:23.699
Come in.

00:34:29.138 --> 00:34:29.739
Mr. Sheng.

00:34:30.073 --> 00:34:31.040
It's an invitation to the
JIANGHU City Chamber of.

00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:32.141
Commerce dinner.

00:34:32.642 --> 00:34:34.610
Inviting you to co-host next weekend.

00:34:37.213 --> 00:34:38.213
Turn it down.

00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:39.815
Say I'm sick.

00:34:39.916 --> 00:34:40.916
No time for socializing.

00:34:41.384 --> 00:34:42.384
Okay.

00:34:43.486 --> 00:34:44.486
Mr. Sheng.

00:34:46.456 --> 00:34:47.757
It's not good to curse yourself.

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:49.192
Don't say that in the future.

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:50.936
You have to learn to avoid jinxing it.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.562
What I say has nothing to do with you.

00:34:53.463 --> 00:34:55.298
Is Mr. Hua meddling too much?

00:34:55.698 --> 00:34:56.698
Mr. Sheng.

00:34:57.767 --> 00:34:59.102
Do I annoy you?

00:35:01.337 --> 00:35:03.706
Yes, pretty much.

00:35:06.476 --> 00:35:07.476
Don't say that

00:35:08.544 --> 00:35:09.612
I'll be sad.

00:35:10.246 --> 00:35:11.781
Can liars also be sad?

00:35:12.148 --> 00:35:14.317
Aren't you confident in everything?

00:35:16.352 --> 00:35:20.156
Your personality, background, experiences

00:35:20.423 --> 00:35:22.025
all are fake.

00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:25.294
All my previous understanding of you

00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:27.029
was based on lies.

00:35:28.398 --> 00:35:30.266
Everything was set up by you in advance.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.769
You're the one holding all the cards.

00:35:34.037 --> 00:35:36.472
I'm just an NPC in your little dating game.

00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:40.676
You decide whether to pursue me,

00:35:41.244 --> 00:35:42.412
whether to love me

00:35:43.479 --> 00:35:45.715
everything's in your control.

00:35:46.516 --> 00:35:48.551
You've already got what
you wanted, haven't you?

00:35:50.887 --> 00:35:52.688
So why are you still clinging to me?

00:36:07.603 --> 00:36:08.271
Mr. Sheng.

00:36:08.471 --> 00:36:10.372
The public opinion meeting
on the donated reading room

00:36:10.373 --> 00:36:11.373
is about to start.

00:36:11.574 --> 00:36:12.809
Need to postpone it?

00:36:14.577 --> 00:36:15.577
No need.

00:36:19.515 --> 00:36:20.515
Mr. Sheng.

00:36:21.517 --> 00:36:23.619
Will you never forgive me?

00:36:28.124 --> 00:36:29.124
Yes.

00:36:29.725 --> 00:36:31.160
So don't ever appear again.

00:36:39.135 --> 00:36:40.169
Hello, Mr. Sheng.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.614
You come in first.

00:36:51.714 --> 00:36:52.714
Mm.

00:36:56.986 --> 00:36:59.021
Mr. Hua, do you have something else?

00:37:00.823 --> 00:37:02.024
I won't keep you

00:37:02.225 --> 00:37:03.265
I'll wait for you outside.

00:37:09.665 --> 00:37:10.733
Why are you looking at me?

00:37:13.135 --> 00:37:14.895
Is there a public
relations case on my face?

00:37:21.777 --> 00:37:22.777
Mr. Sheng.

00:37:23.012 --> 00:37:23.846
Our public relations department

00:37:23.847 --> 00:37:24.880
hopes you can personally accept

00:37:24.881 --> 00:37:26.314
an interview with a popular talk show

00:37:26.315 --> 00:37:27.382
to eliminate

00:37:27.383 --> 00:37:29.552
the audience's misunderstanding

00:37:30.286 --> 00:37:31.187
on SHENGFANG's donation intentions.

00:37:31.188 --> 00:37:33.268
We've scheduled the most
influential host available.

00:37:33.556 --> 00:37:35.358
He's already waiting in our filming area.

00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:36.425
As long as you agree

00:37:36.426 --> 00:37:38.127
he can interview you after the meeting.

00:37:55.945 --> 00:37:57.013
Here, look.

00:37:57.146 --> 00:37:58.881
Do you have to follow me to the bathroom?

00:38:02.051 --> 00:38:03.051
Shaoyou.

00:38:05.955 --> 00:38:06.989
It's really you.

00:38:07.423 --> 00:38:09.125
I recognized you by your back just now.

00:38:09.292 --> 00:38:10.059
Long time no see.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.227
How have you been lately?

00:38:12.628 --> 00:38:13.695
Song Huancheng.

00:38:13.696 --> 00:38:15.031
Yes, it's me.

00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:17.365
My agent asked me if I wanted to come.

00:38:17.366 --> 00:38:18.934
When I thought about
interviewing SHENGFANG Biotech

00:38:18.935 --> 00:38:20.736
I thought I might meet you.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.939
Sure enough, nice to meet you again.

00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:24.339
Nice to meet you.

00:38:43.459 --> 00:38:44.327
Thank you, Mr. Sheng

00:38:44.328 --> 00:38:46.528
for openly sharing with us
SHENGFANG Biotech's original

00:38:46.529 --> 00:38:48.049
intention of participating in charity.

00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:49.298
The earthquake is ruthless

00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:50.499
but there's love among people.

00:38:50.533 --> 00:38:52.300
Although there are many difficulties

00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:53.368
in carrying out good deeds

00:38:53.369 --> 00:38:56.505
the enthusiasm of SHENGFANG
Group is obvious to all.

00:38:56.772 --> 00:38:59.741
Okay, that's all for today's interview.

00:38:59.742 --> 00:39:00.742
Thank you, Mr. Sheng

00:39:00.843 --> 00:39:03.043
and thank you to every
audience in front of the screen.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.250
Thank you.

00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:16.892
It's almost dinner time.

00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:18.599
How about having something together?

00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:23.499
Yes, Reporter Song.

00:39:23.766 --> 00:39:25.167
Have dinner together tonight?

00:39:25.768 --> 00:39:27.536
Well, maybe not.

00:39:27.937 --> 00:39:28.937
We can go together.

00:39:29.405 --> 00:39:30.405
Or

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.709
Is Reporter Song in a
hurry at home tonight?

00:39:35.044 --> 00:39:35.711
Yes

00:39:36.012 --> 00:39:37.312
I still have something urgent at home.

00:39:37.313 --> 00:39:38.147
So I have to go.

00:39:38.148 --> 00:39:39.314
Sorry.

00:39:39.315 --> 00:39:40.349
Excuse me first.

00:39:41.484 --> 00:39:43.152
Hurry up, I'll wait for you outside.

00:39:58.334 --> 00:39:59.334
Mr. Sheng.

00:40:00.703 --> 00:40:01.703
Mr. Sheng.

00:40:03.773 --> 00:40:04.773
Mr. Sheng.

00:40:06.375 --> 00:40:07.455
Do you have something else?

00:40:09.645 --> 00:40:10.546
Can we talk?

00:40:10.579 --> 00:40:11.579
No.

00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:13.214
We have nothing to talk about.

00:40:27.029 --> 00:40:29.364
In the past three years,

00:40:29.365 --> 00:40:31.376
all project donations within
SHENGFANG Biotech's charity fund

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.302
were in the charge of Sheng Shaoqing

00:40:33.836 --> 00:40:35.705
with a total amount exceeding 300 million.

00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:39.342
If the library's construction
was cut corners

00:40:40.943 --> 00:40:43.713
the other amounts handled
are probably also problematic.

00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:54.589
Hello?

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:55.558
Are you the owner of.

00:40:55.559 --> 00:40:58.027
Unit 2902, Building A, Tangcheng Riverside?

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.260
Who's this?

00:40:59.395 --> 00:41:01.596
I'm the local district officer.

00:41:01.597 --> 00:41:03.231
Your tenant just called the police.

00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:05.066
He says someone changed the door cod.

00:41:05.067 --> 00:41:06.936
He can't get in and has nowhere to go.

00:41:07.436 --> 00:41:09.505
Could you come and handle this situation?

00:41:09.972 --> 00:41:11.692
Isn't that what the property manager's for?

00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:14.009
He says he couldn't reach the manager.

00:41:14.143 --> 00:41:16.779
Thinks maybe you changed the code.

00:41:17.413 --> 00:41:18.314
Yeah

00:41:18.315 --> 00:41:19.415
I did.

00:41:19.715 --> 00:41:21.516
But disputes between landlord and tenant

00:41:21.517 --> 00:41:23.152
that's not police business, is it?

00:41:24.019 --> 00:41:25.954
In this country, if
someone's in real trouble

00:41:25.955 --> 00:41:27.256
we're here to help.

00:41:27.423 --> 00:41:28.890
We're

00:41:28.891 --> 00:41:30.059
already at your door.

00:41:30.326 --> 00:41:32.728
Could you come by and help resolve this?

00:41:33.596 --> 00:41:36.198
No. There's nothing to resolve.

00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:38.701
If he has a problem, tell him to sue me.

00:41:39.769 --> 00:41:40.903
Ridiculous.

00:42:27.383 --> 00:42:28.383
What?

00:42:28.617 --> 00:42:30.084
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.

00:42:30.085 --> 00:42:32.788
You coming to the joint
meeting with X Holdings and HS?

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.624
I'm on leave.

00:42:36.325 --> 00:42:38.193
You called the police
just to get Sheng Shaoyou

00:42:38.194 --> 00:42:39.938
to come to your place
in the middle of the night?

00:42:39.962 --> 00:42:42.898
Waited in the garage

00:42:43.098 --> 00:42:44.566
under his building all night,

00:42:44.567 --> 00:42:46.402
just to stay close to him 24/7?

00:42:46.569 --> 00:42:47.569
Hua Yong,

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.550
this is how you're spending your vacation?

00:42:49.872 --> 00:42:52.007
Wenlang, watch your mouth.

00:42:52.942 --> 00:42:53.809
Sheng doesn't talk to me

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:54.910
I'm upset.

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.410
Don't give me attitude just
because you need a punching bag.

00:42:57.746 --> 00:43:00.416
What, you gonna wipe
out my whole family over it?

00:43:00.883 --> 00:43:04.587
Instead of doing this, why
not just eat and sleep properly.

00:43:04.887 --> 00:43:06.989
Ever since Sheng Shaoyou blocked you

00:43:07.256 --> 00:43:08.756
you barely sleep,

00:43:08.757 --> 00:43:09.859
barely eat.

00:43:10.059 --> 00:43:11.539
You just follow him around every day.

00:43:11.727 --> 00:43:12.727
Hua Yong,

00:43:13.028 --> 00:43:14.696
this is unhealthy dependence.

00:43:14.697 --> 00:43:16.931
It's a condition, you'd
better treat it early.

00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:18.467
Might even be curable.

00:43:20.503 --> 00:43:22.137
But don't just worry about me.

00:43:22.872 --> 00:43:24.752
What about that Omega
who took your first time.

00:43:25.174 --> 00:43:26.642
Did Secretary Gao find him yet.

00:43:29.512 --> 00:43:32.047
Gao Tu said the photo you
gave him only shows the back.

00:43:32.214 --> 00:43:33.214
No face.

00:43:33.249 --> 00:43:34.282
He's trying to identify
him through security

00:43:34.283 --> 00:43:35.443
footage based on the clothes.

00:43:36.418 --> 00:43:37.418
Hua Yong,

00:43:38.053 --> 00:43:39.722
are you hiding something.

00:43:40.489 --> 00:43:42.391
I already told Secretary
Gao everything I know.

00:43:42.691 --> 00:43:44.193
With his skills,

00:43:44.393 --> 00:43:46.896
he should be able to figure out.

00:43:59.174 --> 00:44:01.210
Are you sure you can pull this off later.

00:44:01.644 --> 00:44:04.412
Sheng Shaoyou is an S-class Alpha.

00:44:04.413 --> 00:44:06.147
Strength, speed, physique

00:44:06.148 --> 00:44:08.150
none of us can match him.

00:44:08.317 --> 00:44:11.052
Relax, I've got knockout gas ready.

00:44:11.053 --> 00:44:13.789
Same kind poachers use
on wild elephants in Africa.

00:44:13.856 --> 00:44:16.125
If it were any regular Alpha,

00:44:16.358 --> 00:44:17.993
they'd barely survive it.

00:45:03.973 --> 00:45:06.342
Drive, don't lose them.

00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:07.743
The one in that car.

00:45:07.744 --> 00:45:09.044
That's my Alpha
