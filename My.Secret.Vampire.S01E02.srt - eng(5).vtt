00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.400
What happened?

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.720
Was it a dream?

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.940
Hey, let go.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.289
Hey, what were you doing just now?

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.870
I was just saying hi to someone
I've never seen before.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.930
You misunderstood.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.390
You say hi to people sleeping?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.760
Sometimes.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.860
What's going on?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.590
You're still up. Were you waiting for me?

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.350
No way.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.500
So sad.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.360
Who is he? He's cute.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.890
Cute, my foot.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.250
What does going to university

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.280
have anything to do
with living with someone?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.640
I guess it's like a practice?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.110
I really don't understand
what Okhee is thinking.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.400
But she cares about you the most.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.720
Never mind,
I'll just hold out for a month.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.840
So don't cause unnecessary trouble too.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.100
Well, that depends on how you fair.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.810
Drink this.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.230
You always drink this when you're sick.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.550
How did you know I was sick?

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.850
I heard it from Okhee.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.970
Why does she keep contacting you?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.710
Sorry for causing trouble.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.560
I like it though.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.210
I went out because it was cloudy outside,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.940
but I couldn't even buy my book.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.140
This?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.579
You...

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.100
This is the first print version.
Where did you get it?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.440
Give me a kiss.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.300
Have you ever been slapped by a book?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.030
He knows how to smile.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.590
Hello.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.110
My name is Han Dongha
who just moved in today.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.950
My name is Kang Seonjae.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.310
Seems like you were sleeping.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.390
Just a little.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.030
I was probably too tired
so I got sleep paralysis.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.430
But Seonjae–I mean, Mr. Seonjae,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.030
how should I address you?

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.260
Well... You can just call me hyung.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.360
Okay, Seonjae hyung.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.260
But...

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.840
Why?

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.750
You're really handsome.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.120
You have good taste.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.360
Stop talking nonsense. Go to sleep.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.520
Why did you tell him that?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.800
He's so cute.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.050
Why? Are you jealous?

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.770
I heard human blood is delicious,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.470
and we have one living with us now..

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.200
This is God's revelation.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.390
Do you remember
the Romanian phrase we learned?

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.850
I almost forgot.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.500
When you suck blood,
you can't cause harm to humans

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.740
or reveal your identity.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.430
First, bite the vein.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.159
You should suck
only an appropriate amount of blood.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.550
If you suck too much,
you might lose control.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.120
The conditions for whether a human is
suitable for bloodsucking are

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.850
height, weight, and pulse...

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.080
Why are there so many?

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.470
It's going to take forever to read this.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.340
Shall we ask Seonjae when he comes?

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.310
Or we could just ask Joowon.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.090
We can't ask Joowon that!

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.460
He...

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.500
[Resume: Han Dongha]

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.590
This is quite remarkable.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.160
My home is in the countryside,
so I couldn't get it printed.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.980
How much of a countryside is it?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.910
The kind surrounded by mountains.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.440
You came to Seoul alone for school?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.170
Yes.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.990
Where do you live now?

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.660
I'm living in a share house nearby.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.790
I see.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.850
But why did you decide
to apply here?

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.480
I liked sweets since I was a kid, so...

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.940
Okay.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.100
Then, when can you go to work?

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.630
That's the most important.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.900
Right now.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.820
[Ice Cube, Lee Joowon]

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.960
This is for the umbrella.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.580
No, that's not what I meant.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.780
Let's keep a distance between us.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.700
[Lee Joowon]

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.159
Why was Han Dongha's room
suddenly changed?

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.670
Is Joowon spying on us

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.080
just in case we bite him?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.990
Is it because of me?

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.820
Did you bite him?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.080
I didn't get to taste it though.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.480
Brother, let us have him.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.950
This is our first chance.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.010
But do we have to change rooms?

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.320
Why can't he drink some blood
since living under the same roof?

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.890
He hates that.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.450
What does human blood taste like?

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.680
Is it good?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.440
Of course.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.940
Is it different from blood plasma?

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.290
Hey. They can't be compared.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.040
You're so daring.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.360
What if you get caught?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.530
The moment the teeth
bite through the flesh,

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.600
the sweetness of human blood
spread instantly.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.650
The refreshing blood
will flow down through the esophagus–

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.700
What flows along the esophagus?

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.190
It's a gift to commemorate
your first day at work.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.100
Go eat it with your housemates.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.230
Okay.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.450
Even if it's just for a month,
I should get along with them.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.870
I'm home.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.810
Huh? Why is my luggage outside?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.950
What are you doing?

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.950
Can't you see? I'm moving your stuff.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.580
Who allowed you to do that?

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.510
If you don't like me, just tell me.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.039
Why do such a despicable thing?

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:41.970
Huh?

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.330
You told me not to interfere
with your private life,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.930
but you're entering my room
on your own accord?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.600
Are you the landlady?

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.000
Everything's moved out.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.260
Is there only one bag left?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.560
You misunderstood.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.200
I'll move out on my own in a month.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.680
So don't worry.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.920
What's with the two of them?

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.470
It feels off.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.970
You're right.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.140
I shouldn't have done that.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.150
Dongha.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.270
Your room was moved to the first floor.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.780
Didn't you see the text?

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.910
Text?

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:26.380
Yes.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.980
The room on the first floor
is bigger and nicer.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.300
I...

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.990
I'm sorry.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.750
I thought you were ostracizing me,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.760
so I misunderstood you.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.610
I want to get along with you!

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.390
Though it's just a month,

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.320
we'd still be living
under the same roof after all...

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.610
This is not your home.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.640
He's at it again.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.410
He may sound cold,

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.930
but he changed your room for your sake.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.640
So don't think of it too much.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.040
For my sake?

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.160
Joowon feels that you shouldn't
stay by yourself on the second floor.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.860
After you get to know us,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.040
you'd know that Joowon's
the most humane among us.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.990
Humane? Him?

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.450
Yes.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.620
You're probably saying that
cause you're close to him.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.820
Do we look close?

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.000
Yes.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.770
When I saw
the two of you together last time,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.560
you seemed close.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.760
Anyway, don't fight and get along.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.930
Got it, hyung.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.130
He's good at cutting tomatoes.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.860
Did he learn it?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.570
But... we can't eat this.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.290
But this is his sincerity.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.480
Did you put something in it?

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.360
What?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.170
It's really delicious.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.870
Really?

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.970
Well...

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.680
I made some toast.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.710
I'm full.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.110
Even his rejection's so casual.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.690
Done cleaning the bathroom.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.040
When can I finish cleaning this place?

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.280
You don't look like someone
who likes books.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.610
Then what do I look like?

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.270
Are you done looking?

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.020
When did I look...

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.770
I'm talking about the book.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.080
Ah...

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.780
Right.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.810
Don't touch my stuff

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.970
in the future.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.030
He's so annoying.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.140
This is amazing.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.690
I think my chronic rhinitis is healed.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.560
Cold-blooded man.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.450
No, he's not even human.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.050
Are you okay?

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.410
Yes.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.260
Thank you.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.690
I don't know if I should say this now...

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.040
But what's your weight?

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.670
It's over for us, right?

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.330
According to the rules, his weight isn't
the standard for blood sucking.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.860
That's what I think, at least.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.100
Lee Okhee!

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.320
I knew this would happen.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.110
Calm down.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.180
That's what she meant by
he can't be eaten.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.610
I was looking forward to it...

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.540
Even when
I was eating expired blood plasma,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.320
I have been holding out with this thought.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.830
He's a prey that can't be eaten.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.760
Let's ask him to just move out, okay?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.380
I think that's better.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.900
Then let him gain weight.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.770
I like Han Dongha.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.880
So let him eat well and sleep well,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.240
and gain weight.
