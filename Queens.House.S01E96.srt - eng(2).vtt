00:00:01.578 --> 00:00:02.848
(Episode 96)

00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:08.288
Dad, the book, please.

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:12.728
Dad?

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:14.628
Are you sick?

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:18.198
If you're sick, you have to take medicine.

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:23.838
Medicine is bitter, so have this.

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:26.468
Have some candy, and it won't be bitter at all.

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:31.608
Ji Ho.

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:32.908
Yes?

00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:39.718
Here.

00:00:40.288 --> 00:00:42.688
Oh, right. I should give one to Uncle too.

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.338
(A: Hwang Gi Chan, B: Hwang Ji Ho, Paternity Test: Mismatch)

00:01:01.338 --> 00:01:02.538
(Are not biologically related)

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:11.748
(Paternity Test Result)

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:22.828
This blank minus this blank.

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:24.358
What does that even mean?

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.168
Mom!

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:28.268
Oh, hey, Ji Ho.

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:31.208
I need to talk to your dad now, so let's talk later.

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:32.938
Dad's in his study.

00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:47.318
This is no time for you to be acting like this.

00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:50.088
How long will you mope around and skip work?

00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:53.288
Kang Mi Ran is up to something.

00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:55.498
The board of directors seems to be meeting frequently.

00:01:55.898 --> 00:01:57.868
And it looks like Kang Jae In keeps joining them.

00:01:58.528 --> 00:01:59.598
Something's up.

00:02:01.698 --> 00:02:03.968
They're hell-bent on dragging you down.

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.438
If I were still a team leader, I could attend their meetings...

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.408
and get some information.

00:02:09.878 --> 00:02:12.108
This is no time for you to be relaxing.

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:16.618
Contact the board members now, see what's happening, and act.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.258
Are you even listening to me?

00:02:23.558 --> 00:02:25.758
Shouldn't you be figuring out what to do?

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:42.978
(Designer Kang Jae In)

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.038
Come in.

00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:48.478
What? You haven't left yet?

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:51.078
I'm about to.

00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:53.688
I saw the light was on, so I came in to see who it was.

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.188
I'll be leaving soon too.

00:02:56.788 --> 00:02:58.528
Let's go together, then. I'll give you a ride.

00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:03.198
Do Yun said he'd give me a ride since he's heading my way.

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:08.568
By the way, about that woman, Kang Se Ri...

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:12.638
Remember when she got a new laptop and dared you to look, not sneak?

00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:15.038
What's on it?

00:03:16.938 --> 00:03:19.808
H and K Company's double contract.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:25.188
The one Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee was probing before the accident?

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:27.048
That's right.

00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:31.388
Since Kang Se Ri is Catherine, the CEO of H and K Company,

00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:36.058
there must be a YL Group contract, so I went through her laptop.

00:03:36.358 --> 00:03:38.198
Oh, so did you find it?

00:03:39.368 --> 00:03:43.238
I found it, but Kang Se Ri caught me before I could get it.

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:48.378
Now she knows we're looking for it, she must have hidden it even better.

00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:50.208
Probably.

00:03:51.678 --> 00:03:53.408
We'll have to find another way.

00:03:57.378 --> 00:03:59.318
- Oh, you fold them so well. - Thank you.

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.958
Hey, Mi Ran bought some clothes for you.

00:04:13.968 --> 00:04:16.368
Tell her to stop buying and sending me things.

00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:19.638
Come on. The misunderstanding's cleared up,

00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:21.708
and you know about Seung Woo now.

00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:25.478
Can't you open your heart to her, just a little bit?

00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:30.748
You were adrift for nearly 30 years.

00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:33.248
Watching you fall apart, watching you drift aimlessly,

00:04:33.988 --> 00:04:36.858
that's how long I've spent worrying sick about you.

00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:38.488
I know.

00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:42.128
I know I've made you suffer so much.

00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:44.498
If you know that, don't bring me these things again.

00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:49.598
If gifts were enough to forgive her, none of this would have happened.

00:04:51.568 --> 00:04:52.838
All right, I get it.

00:04:55.038 --> 00:04:58.148
Are you and Little Grandpa fighting?

00:05:00.378 --> 00:05:01.478
Fighting? Of course not.

00:05:02.278 --> 00:05:04.688
Your little grandpa is Grandma's little brother.

00:05:05.018 --> 00:05:07.618
I was just nagging him a little because I was worried, okay?

00:05:07.718 --> 00:05:10.288
That's right, Bo Ram. Nagging out of love.

00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:15.198
Goodness, Bo Ram. You're doing great folding the laundry!

00:05:18.628 --> 00:05:19.698
Here, give them to me.

00:05:24.138 --> 00:05:25.238
Do you remember this?

00:05:25.838 --> 00:05:28.008
The one you told Ji Ho to give to me.

00:05:30.408 --> 00:05:31.948
This isn't my handwriting.

00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:33.978
This is a grown-up's handwriting.

00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:36.278
Take a closer look.

00:05:37.048 --> 00:05:38.388
It's your handwriting from before you got hurt.

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:42.188
"If something happens to me, it's Kang Se Ri's doing."

00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:46.788
Kang Se Ri is your wife, isn't she? Ji Ho's mom.

00:05:47.328 --> 00:05:48.458
That's all I know.

00:05:50.128 --> 00:05:51.128
Okay.

00:05:52.098 --> 00:05:53.098
Listen.

00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:55.238
What I just showed you is a secret.

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:58.138
Don't tell anyone. Got it?

00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:01.268
I'm a grown-up, so I keep my promises.

00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:06.978
I have to find out if Kang Se Ri is the one who hurt you.

00:06:08.048 --> 00:06:10.918
Until then, I have to keep her close so she doesn't try anything funny.

00:06:27.898 --> 00:06:28.968
Heading to work?

00:06:29.668 --> 00:06:31.538
- Yes. - It's the right call.

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:34.108
You have to show Kang Mi Ran and DH Holdings...

00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:37.208
that they can't just take your place from you.

00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:40.908
YL Group is yours, not anyone else's.

00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:50.858
Mom said she's going to eat later.

00:06:54.798 --> 00:06:57.958
Gi Chan, you should go calm her. You know how Mom is.

00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:05.268
Before I take the items to the gallery for appraisal today,

00:07:05.868 --> 00:07:08.178
let me check the inventory list. Would that be all right?

00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:11.108
Of course. I'll arrange it for you.

00:07:20.318 --> 00:07:21.588
Hwang Ji Ho, how old are you?

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:23.418
You're seven years old,

00:07:23.418 --> 00:07:24.418
and you can't even pick up a side dish?

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.658
After all this time, you still can't use chopsticks?

00:07:34.468 --> 00:07:35.498
Don't.

00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:37.838
Try again.

00:07:47.948 --> 00:07:50.018
Who do you take after that you can't even use chopsticks?

00:07:51.348 --> 00:07:53.388
What are you talking about? He takes after you or Se Ri.

00:07:53.688 --> 00:07:54.788
He's your son, isn't he?

00:07:57.658 --> 00:07:58.828
He's just nervous.

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:00.928
Why are you being like this? It's not like you.

00:08:03.828 --> 00:08:04.828
I apologize.

00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:12.408
He doesn't deserve to be treated like that.

00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:22.778
Aren't all children precious?

00:08:24.048 --> 00:08:26.188
You seem to be upset about something,

00:08:27.318 --> 00:08:29.058
but I believe you're taking it out on the wrong person.

00:08:32.488 --> 00:08:33.488
Just finish your meal.

00:09:14.298 --> 00:09:16.098
What about the sincerity you were going to show me?

00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:18.098
Where did you throw it away?

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:23.708
You said you'd turn yourself in.

00:09:24.878 --> 00:09:25.878
You said you'd prove it.

00:09:28.548 --> 00:09:30.018
I wasn't in my right mind when I said that.

00:09:31.518 --> 00:09:33.218
You said you don't believe in empty promises,

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.058
but it looks like you did.

00:09:38.118 --> 00:09:40.028
You've been fooled this whole time and didn't even realize it.

00:09:40.858 --> 00:09:42.058
Kang Jae In.

00:09:42.628 --> 00:09:44.328
Don't trust me too much.

00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:46.628
You jerk.

00:09:48.298 --> 00:09:49.968
I still had a sliver of hope.

00:09:53.338 --> 00:09:54.908
You really are a piece of trash, after all.

00:09:57.338 --> 00:10:00.608
I'll be throwing you in the trash soon enough, so just you wait.

00:10:26.868 --> 00:10:30.038
My sister and Teo. Don't you think they're a good match?

00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:33.008
They seem really into each other, right?

00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:34.848
I'm not so sure.

00:10:35.478 --> 00:10:37.248
Oh, you couldn't tell?

00:10:37.518 --> 00:10:40.988
I have a knack for these things. Not just anyone can be a Cupid.

00:10:42.258 --> 00:10:46.628
To really hook them up for sure, I need to get them alone again.

00:10:47.628 --> 00:10:49.698
Now, where should I have them meet?

00:10:54.098 --> 00:10:56.968
Chef Hong Baek has an award-winning restaurant in Seonwon-dong.

00:10:57.138 --> 00:11:00.268
- Should I book a table for them? - Cupid.

00:11:00.838 --> 00:11:01.938
Let's just stop.

00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:04.838
It's because I like Jae In.

00:11:06.948 --> 00:11:07.948
What?

00:11:09.918 --> 00:11:11.078
My sister?

00:11:19.858 --> 00:11:21.058
Is something wrong?

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.058
It's because of Hwang Gi Chan.

00:11:24.828 --> 00:11:26.968
He told me a while ago he was going to turn himself in.

00:11:27.498 --> 00:11:30.338
He sounded sincere, but I guess I was mistaken.

00:11:30.938 --> 00:11:35.108
I ran into him a moment ago, and he was so smug, acting innocent.

00:11:35.838 --> 00:11:37.308
That's the kind of person he's always been.

00:11:37.938 --> 00:11:39.448
People don't change that easily.

00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:42.448
You're right.

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:46.088
I regret ever believing him, even for a moment.

00:11:46.888 --> 00:11:50.518
All that's left is to take him down. Just hang in there a little longer.

00:11:54.358 --> 00:11:56.398
(Princess)

00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:03.838
Does Hwang Gi Man still come by often?

00:12:05.668 --> 00:12:07.108
I've told him a few times,

00:12:07.868 --> 00:12:10.878
but he keeps coming back with one excuse or another.

00:12:11.978 --> 00:12:14.548
You know he's not well anymore.

00:12:16.678 --> 00:12:19.918
All I can think about is how much my daughter suffered.

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:24.218
It wasn't enough that he laid a hand on you,

00:12:24.388 --> 00:12:26.128
but they ganged up and humiliated you,

00:12:26.388 --> 00:12:28.558
and even hid his infertility.

00:12:31.728 --> 00:12:34.928
Even now, thinking of those people makes my blood boil.

00:12:36.068 --> 00:12:37.238
I'm sorry.

00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:40.308
Instead of enduring it for your sake,

00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:43.078
I should have gotten out sooner.

00:12:48.308 --> 00:12:50.348
Yu Gyeong, I told you to only think of yourself.

00:12:52.448 --> 00:12:56.558
How you're going to get away from that house and Hwang Gi Man...

00:12:56.618 --> 00:12:57.818
is all you should think about.

00:12:58.658 --> 00:13:00.488
Just because he isn't all there,

00:13:00.588 --> 00:13:03.628
doesn't mean you have any obligation to put up with him.

00:13:04.558 --> 00:13:07.268
I guess I subconsciously felt responsible...

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:08.898
for his condition.

00:13:09.798 --> 00:13:12.268
That's also why I couldn't bring myself to be harsh with him.

00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:17.508
You did more than enough living with that jerk Hwang Gi Man.

00:13:19.308 --> 00:13:21.748
No matter how pitiful he seems, don't give in.

00:13:22.448 --> 00:13:25.648
It's important to draw a clear line, especially now.

00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:27.488
Okay.

00:13:27.988 --> 00:13:31.488
I did sit him down and had a serious talk recently.

00:13:31.788 --> 00:13:33.158
But if he comes again,

00:13:33.658 --> 00:13:36.098
I'll ask his siblings, whom I can talk to,

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:37.698
to keep him away.

00:13:38.698 --> 00:13:39.698
Good.

00:13:40.968 --> 00:13:42.638
To me, that jerk Hwang Gi Man...

00:13:43.968 --> 00:13:47.108
is nothing but a parasite who fed on my precious daughter's life.

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:51.308
Don't keep sacrificing and suffering for a guy like that.

Please let me grow up fast so I can meet my princess.

00:14:24.438 --> 00:14:27.978
Mom, I'm heading home now. I'll be there soon.

00:14:30.118 --> 00:14:31.118
Yes?

00:14:33.148 --> 00:14:35.258
Jae In, there's a board meeting soon,

00:14:35.418 --> 00:14:38.258
- and I think you should join us. - Me too?

It's my mom's hospital appointment, and I promised I would go with her.

My dad has work today too.

00:14:55.108 --> 00:14:56.538
I can take her.

00:14:57.508 --> 00:14:58.778
You can?

Yes, I'm free today. I'll go.

Would you? Thank you so much.

Mom.

00:15:25.408 --> 00:15:27.008
Was I a parasite?

00:15:27.638 --> 00:15:29.308
What? What are you talking about?

00:15:30.008 --> 00:15:34.048
Did I hurt the person I loved?

You're not denying it.

00:15:41.788 --> 00:15:43.918

You got duped like an idiot. Who are you taking it out on?

00:16:44.318 --> 00:16:47.688
Because of you, I was made to look like a fool!

00:16:48.148 --> 00:16:52.458
I just did what I was told. But why did you only report me?

00:16:57.428 --> 00:16:58.698
Are you all right?

00:16:59.968 --> 00:17:03.338
We staked out on Kim Do Yun's tip. I had my doubts, but...

00:17:03.338 --> 00:17:05.608
And we finally caught him here.

Oh, give me some of that.

Gosh, Mom, slow down. No one's going to take it from you.

I knew what to expect from that one, but I thought Gi Chan was different.

00:18:08.768 --> 00:18:12.768
Ever since he was a kid, he'd believe and do whatever I said.

00:18:12.908 --> 00:18:16.378
He would've believed me if I told him pigs could fly.

00:18:30.158 --> 00:18:33.528
Oh, Gi Man. You can be a good adult from now on.

00:18:37.758 --> 00:18:40.728
Ji Ho, if using chopsticks is hard, do you want a fork?

No. I'll get good at this for my dad.

00:18:45.908 --> 00:18:47.238

00:19:13.828 --> 00:19:15.028
Mom, I'm a dutiful son too.

00:19:15.128 --> 00:19:18.038
Yes, you're a dutiful son. Such a dutiful son.

00:19:18.738 --> 00:19:20.668
You're good enough to show your dad now.

And I did give you time. Didn't I?

00:19:31.178 --> 00:19:33.088
Asking for more would be cheating.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:36.958
It's not like I'm going to be in Korea forever,

so from now on, I'll handle things my way.

00:19:39.558 --> 00:19:41.258
Are you threatening to expose everything?

00:19:41.758 --> 00:19:44.198

00:21:47.488 --> 00:21:49.058
You must have been really shaken up today.

00:21:52.258 --> 00:21:53.528
Shaken up? Of course not.

Auntie, did you see it?

00:22:28.728 --> 00:22:30.958
He said he made it himself, you know.

00:22:32.028 --> 00:22:33.968
I'm not just saying this because he's your brother,

00:22:34.598 --> 00:22:37.768
but if you really look at him, he's a very thoughtful person.

00:22:39.538 --> 00:22:43.178

I thought you were leaving a gift for your favorite mentee.

00:29:07.828 --> 00:29:10.958
I forgot to back up color charts so I was just transferring them.

00:29:12.158 --> 00:29:14.098
Gosh, you're amazing!

00:29:14.328 --> 00:29:19.268
I want to be a sharp senior like you who even looks after her juniors.

00:29:20.638 --> 00:29:22.068
Teach me your ways!

00:29:22.508 --> 00:29:23.638
Master.

00:29:24.708 --> 00:29:26.248
You feel guilty for taking a half-day, don't you?

00:29:26.648 --> 00:29:28.448
Stop buttering me up and just go.

00:29:29.148 --> 00:29:30.918
Just as I thought. A true senior.

00:29:31.518 --> 00:29:32.518
Yes.

00:29:34.248 --> 00:29:35.248
All right.

00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:40.958
Kang Seung Woo.

00:29:42.088 --> 00:29:43.098
Yes?

00:29:43.898 --> 00:29:45.428
It's not exactly a secret,

00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:49.368
but whenever I feel hopeless and lost,

00:29:49.898 --> 00:29:51.268
I think back to the beginning.

00:29:53.168 --> 00:29:55.668
Why I'm doing this work, and how I got here.

00:29:56.038 --> 00:29:57.038
Things like that?

00:29:59.608 --> 00:30:01.208
Those books I gave you...

00:30:02.178 --> 00:30:04.948
My mentor actually gave them to me as a gift.

00:30:05.978 --> 00:30:07.088
I still read them now and then.

00:30:09.818 --> 00:30:10.818
Message received!

00:30:11.318 --> 00:30:13.388
Then I shall take my leave.

00:30:18.758 --> 00:30:19.768
Master!

00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:21.498
Oh, you startled me.

00:30:23.438 --> 00:30:25.098
- Go on. - Okay!

00:30:26.738 --> 00:30:28.838
("The Money, Global Management Strategy")

(Overseas Factory Establishment Contracts A and B)

00:30:49.628 --> 00:30:50.628
Bingo.

(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:31:08.648 --> 00:31:09.648
Off to the shareholders' meeting?

00:31:11.178 --> 00:31:12.178
I am.

00:31:13.048 --> 00:31:15.688
You're Hwang Gi Chan, the chairman of YL Group.

00:31:17.118 --> 00:31:19.318
Don't back down, and act with confidence.

00:31:20.528 --> 00:31:22.258
You must hold on to your position, no matter what.

00:31:22.958 --> 00:31:23.958
Got it?

00:31:51.418 --> 00:31:54.828

(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

00:32:15.008 --> 00:32:19.178
We'll begin the emergency meeting to dismiss Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

00:32:21.018 --> 00:32:22.418
Before we proceed to the vote,

00:32:22.788 --> 00:32:25.418
Managing Director Kang Mi Ran will make an opening statement.

00:32:26.688 --> 00:32:31.058
Our internal audit shows that besides the Louis B project,

00:32:32.198 --> 00:32:33.868
both before and after his appointment as chairman,

00:32:34.228 --> 00:32:36.938
he has committed countless acts...

00:32:37.568 --> 00:32:38.598
of corruption.

00:32:41.438 --> 00:32:43.138
Don't tell me you're using circumstantial evidence...

00:32:43.638 --> 00:32:45.378
as proof, are you?

00:32:45.808 --> 00:32:46.848
Of course not.

00:32:47.678 --> 00:32:50.918
You don't think I'd hunt a viper bare-handed, do you?

00:32:51.218 --> 00:32:53.248
Just in case you thought you could squirm your way out,

00:32:54.448 --> 00:32:57.718
it took some effort to narrow down the overwhelming amount of evidence.

00:33:00.288 --> 00:33:01.288
Come in.

00:33:32.318 --> 00:33:35.658
Allow me to congratulate you in advance on your dismissal,

00:33:37.598 --> 00:33:38.598

(Queen's House)

00:34:26.848 --> 00:34:27.948
Just wait a little longer.

00:34:28.808 --> 00:34:30.648
Everything that Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri stole from us,

00:34:31.078 --> 00:34:32.418
we're going to take it all back.

00:34:32.848 --> 00:34:34.618
I couldn't see it when I was blinded,

00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:36.958
but now that all my desperation is gone,

00:34:37.318 --> 00:34:39.388
I can see everything clearly, as if a fog has lifted.

00:34:39.658 --> 00:34:40.958
Only now can I see everything.

00:34:42.358 --> 00:34:45.828
The first to discover this truth and launch an investigation,

00:34:46.828 --> 00:34:49.498
was none other than the victim of the hit-and-run,

00:34:51.738 --> 00:34:52.798
