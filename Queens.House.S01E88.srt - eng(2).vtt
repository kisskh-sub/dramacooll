WEBVTT

00:00:00.883 --> 00:00:02.023
I'm the one who killed her.

00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:04.853
I killed Kim Do Hee!

00:00:08.123 --> 00:00:09.363
What... What are you doing?

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.933
Stop it.

00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:14.133
Son, you're okay, aren't you?

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:15.733
You're okay, right?

00:00:18.073 --> 00:00:20.403
Seung Woo, don't worry.

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:24.243
Mom will take care of everything.

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:26.443
Just trust Mom.

00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:30.913
Detective, it wasn't my son.

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:33.123
He could never do something like that.

00:00:34.023 --> 00:00:35.023
It was me.

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:36.593
I did it.

00:00:36.723 --> 00:00:38.593
Ma'am, I think there's a misunderstanding.

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:39.923
But I'm telling you it's true!

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:42.123
It was me.

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:43.533
I killed her.

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:45.533
Arrest me.

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:47.163
Take me in.

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.003
You're not taking my Seung Woo!

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:52.503
It wasn't my son.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:54.243
I did it.

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:57.343
Believe me and arrest me.

00:00:58.473 --> 00:01:00.513
Cuff me. What are you waiting for?

00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:02.383
- It was me. - Please, just stop!

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:04.153
Why do you keep doing this?

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.283
Everyone's watching.

00:01:09.353 --> 00:01:10.393
Seung Woo.

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:11.893
Don't you worry about a thing.

00:01:12.623 --> 00:01:14.023
Let them stare.

00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:16.733
Mom will protect our Seung Woo.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.763
My son. I promise.

00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:24.173
What are you all waiting for?

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.443
I told you to take me in!

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:30.413
I killed her. Arrest me!

00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:33.583
Arrest me. I did it!

00:01:34.143 --> 00:01:36.813
I killed her! I'm the one who killed her!

00:01:45.053 --> 00:01:46.123
You should get some rest.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.663
- Help her lie down. - Okay.

00:01:50.833 --> 00:01:51.833
Here.

00:02:00.843 --> 00:02:02.043
Seung Woo, don't go.

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:04.473
Don't you go anywhere.

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:08.183
Don't worry. I'm here with you.

00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:10.013
Just get some deep sleep.

00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:26.093
Mister...

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:27.963
My mom...

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:30.473
My mom's been acting strange.

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:34.303
Your sister will be here soon.

00:02:47.023 --> 00:02:48.023
How's Mom?

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:49.723
She fell asleep.

00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:52.723
Jae In, something's strange about Mom.

00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:55.423
I don't know how to explain it, but...

00:02:56.693 --> 00:02:57.733
she's just really...

00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:02.633
- I mean... - Seung Woo, let me explain.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:05.333
I think it's time you knew.

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:08.643
So, you're saying...

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:13.013
what happened to Dad and Kim Do Hee...

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:17.753
was all that guy Hwang Gi Chan's doing?

00:03:23.493 --> 00:03:24.493
So then,

00:03:24.993 --> 00:03:28.023
what Mom said about Kim Do Hee...

00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:29.523
Mom didn't do it.

00:03:30.893 --> 00:03:32.033
There's a recording.

00:03:33.263 --> 00:03:34.903
I can play it for you if you want,

00:03:35.763 --> 00:03:37.373
but I'd rather you didn't.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.873
It'll haunt you for a long time.

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:42.303
She's right, Seung Woo.

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:44.473
I agree with Jae In.

00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:47.413
It will only hurt you more to hear it.

00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:49.413
So then...

00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:53.383
is that why Mom has dementia?

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:55.623
We don't know the exact cause,

00:03:56.753 --> 00:03:58.723
but the stress must have been a huge part of it.

00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:01.193
It's a lot to take in, isn't it?

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:04.093
I should have told you sooner.

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:07.403
It's my fault.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:11.103
Because of me,

00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:14.203
she must've been under so much stress.

00:04:16.573 --> 00:04:18.913
Imagine how hard it must have been for 27 years.

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:21.783
No.

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:24.253
That's not true, Seung Woo.

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:27.623
She's right. It's not your fault.

00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:31.593
The way your mother acted at the police station today...

00:04:32.323 --> 00:04:33.993
is how she truly feels about you.

00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:37.063
Remember what I told you?

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:40.403
I've been by your mother's side for a long time,

00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:43.733
and she cares for you so much, Seung Woo.

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:46.003
Of course,

00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:49.173
I'm sure there were times she resented you,

00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:53.343
but deep down, she loved you.

00:04:55.813 --> 00:04:57.053
It's all my fault.

00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:04.553
I'm just going to go check on her.

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:13.233
Mom.

00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:15.963
Mom.

00:05:17.303 --> 00:05:18.403
Mom.

00:05:26.643 --> 00:05:27.783
Why didn't you tell me?

00:05:28.683 --> 00:05:29.683
Why?

00:05:30.483 --> 00:05:32.013
I only found out recently myself.

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:36.283
Mom wanted to keep it a secret.

00:05:37.423 --> 00:05:38.893
Especially from you.

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:41.523
She was afraid we would be too shocked,

00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:43.433
and that it would be too hard on us.

00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:45.963
Mom was worried about us, too.

00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:48.763
You get it, right?

00:05:57.213 --> 00:05:58.673
I'm sorry, Jae In.

00:06:00.913 --> 00:06:02.013
Seung Woo.

00:06:26.103 --> 00:06:27.103
Ja Young.

00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:31.013
I'm sorry.

00:06:33.913 --> 00:06:34.913
Seung Woo.

00:06:38.653 --> 00:06:40.823
Ja Young, are you all right?

00:06:46.023 --> 00:06:47.923
I must have had a nightmare.

00:06:48.693 --> 00:06:49.863
Where's Jae In?

00:06:50.093 --> 00:06:51.393
She's outside.

00:06:52.093 --> 00:06:53.633
Seung Woo is out there, too.

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:56.403
Don't say anything about my condition to Seung Woo.

00:06:56.873 --> 00:06:58.603
You know what I mean, right?

00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:02.543
Yes, I understand.

00:07:04.243 --> 00:07:05.913
Why are you holding my hand?

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:12.183
Because there's so much I have to apologise for.

00:07:14.553 --> 00:07:16.153
Especially about Seung Woo.

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:20.563
Ja Young...

00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:25.563
Can't we please make up?

00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:29.503
Now that Gyu Chul is gone,

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:33.473
you're the only family...

00:07:34.903 --> 00:07:36.613
I have left.

00:07:40.113 --> 00:07:41.243
I...

00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:44.453
I'm so, so sorry.

00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:48.523
I apologised to Jae In, too.

00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:53.493
And what did she say?

00:07:57.433 --> 00:07:59.093
She forgave me.

00:08:00.633 --> 00:08:03.373
As for me, it'll depend on your actions from now on.

00:08:03.803 --> 00:08:05.333
I'm not Jae In.

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:09.773
I know.

00:08:13.513 --> 00:08:15.013
I'll do better.

00:08:15.843 --> 00:08:18.513
Come on, sit down.

00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:24.323
If this is about that woman, I'm not changing my mind.

00:08:24.723 --> 00:08:25.953
Yun Hee.

00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:32.133
I want you to forget the past, meet someone new, and start over.

00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:34.562
I can't just let go of the past.

00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:36.032
My relationship with Mi Ran...

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:40.203
isn't something that can just end with the two of us.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.043
What do you mean by that?

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:46.313
Yun Hee. Listen to me, and don't freak out.

00:08:47.713 --> 00:08:48.983
I have...

00:08:50.653 --> 00:08:51.983
a child.

00:08:52.813 --> 00:08:54.023
A child?

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:58.322
Don't tell me you were actually talking about yourself...

00:08:58.323 --> 00:09:01.193
when you told me about that friend whose girlfriend was pregnant.

00:09:01.793 --> 00:09:05.093
Are you saying that woman, Kang Mi Ran, is pregnant?

00:09:05.633 --> 00:09:06.633
No,

00:09:08.263 --> 00:09:10.903
that was just a misunderstanding.

00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:15.703
I have a grown son.

00:09:16.273 --> 00:09:18.013
And it's someone you know, Yun Hee.

00:09:18.773 --> 00:09:20.213
It's Kang Seung Woo.

00:09:23.183 --> 00:09:24.383
What are you talking about?

00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:29.383
So...

00:09:30.593 --> 00:09:32.593
Even though he was raised as Jae In's brother,

00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:35.323
he's actually Kang Mi Ran's son?

00:09:35.823 --> 00:09:40.003
And Seung Woo only found out about his birth mother recently, too?

00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:41.663
Yes.

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.203
He was raised to believe he was Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol's son.

00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:47.773
I only found out recently, too.

00:09:48.103 --> 00:09:49.572
We'd decided to get back together,

00:09:49.573 --> 00:09:51.973
but then we broke up after I learned the truth.

00:09:52.973 --> 00:09:56.813
But we're back where we started. My heart won't listen, Yun Hee.

00:09:58.413 --> 00:09:59.853
What a pity.

00:10:00.653 --> 00:10:04.523
After hearing all this, I despise that woman even more.

00:10:04.653 --> 00:10:08.393
- Yun Hee. - For almost 30 years,

00:10:08.493 --> 00:10:11.263
she had Choi Ja Young raise him.

00:10:12.493 --> 00:10:16.603
Her brother's family raised Seung Woo in her place,

00:10:16.903 --> 00:10:20.173
so how could she be so cruel to her niece, Jae In?

00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:23.643
That's because Jae In's mother let Seung Woo take the blame.

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:26.173
And I think Mi Ran resented her for that.

00:10:26.243 --> 00:10:27.713
Whatever the excuse,

00:10:28.383 --> 00:10:29.713
she laid low all this time,

00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:33.053
and when her brother died, she showed her true colours.

00:10:33.953 --> 00:10:35.823
She waltzed in, playing the concerned mother,

00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:38.222
to use Seung Woo as a pawn to take over YL Group.

00:10:38.223 --> 00:10:39.793
That's the only way I see it.

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:41.623
Ask anyone on the street.

00:10:41.863 --> 00:10:44.463
It's not just me. Anyone would come to the same conclusion.

00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:46.562
Of course, she was in the wrong.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.063
I'm not saying Mi Ran is blameless.

00:10:49.263 --> 00:10:53.203
But she misunderstood some things because she didn't know everything.

00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:55.173
Even if it wasn't true,

00:10:55.603 --> 00:10:58.143
family should have your back.

00:10:58.743 --> 00:11:03.383
But she's doing her best to clean up all the mess she's made.

00:11:04.053 --> 00:11:06.683
Stuff like that won't happen again. So please...

00:11:06.753 --> 00:11:08.783
What are you, her spokesperson? Her lawyer?

00:11:09.383 --> 00:11:10.493
I've heard enough.

00:11:12.453 --> 00:11:14.193
Let me make myself perfectly clear.

00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:18.693
Kang Mi Ran was a zero in my book, but now she's in the negatives.

00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:42.483
Hey! Hwang Gi Chan!

00:11:47.863 --> 00:11:51.762
Our father was so good to you!

00:11:51.763 --> 00:11:53.663
How could you kill my father?

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:57.103
You murderer! You're an animal!

00:11:57.173 --> 00:12:00.473
Seung Woo, stop! Don't! Please, just stop!

00:12:03.643 --> 00:12:04.743
Are you insane?

00:12:05.813 --> 00:12:07.143
How dare you get violent?

00:12:07.613 --> 00:12:10.283
Who are you to yell at me? You're the baby of the family.

00:12:11.553 --> 00:12:14.483
Where's security? Get them in here, now!

00:12:19.023 --> 00:12:20.923
Shut your mouth, you murderer.

00:12:22.223 --> 00:12:25.633
Do you really think the recording our father left is gone for good?

00:12:26.263 --> 00:12:29.833
Just because I gave you the master, right?

00:12:31.073 --> 00:12:32.773
Go ahead. Report Seung Woo.

00:12:33.233 --> 00:12:36.843
I just need to make our father's last words public.

00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:38.113
Go on. Try me.

00:12:41.613 --> 00:12:42.983
Seung Woo, let's go.

00:13:05.503 --> 00:13:07.473
Have you calmed down?

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:11.973
When I saw him,

00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:14.343
I just saw red.

00:13:15.713 --> 00:13:17.313
I lunged at him before I even knew what I was doing.

00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:19.983
I just wanted to kill him.

00:13:21.823 --> 00:13:23.623
If it weren't for him,

00:13:24.623 --> 00:13:26.693
Mom wouldn't have ended up this way.

00:13:28.663 --> 00:13:30.193
I feel so bad for Mom.

00:13:32.363 --> 00:13:34.163
Jae In, what are we going to do about Mom?

00:13:34.903 --> 00:13:37.033
I'm going crazy just thinking about her.

00:13:39.373 --> 00:13:43.613
All the awful words I said to her... I resented her, I cursed her.

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.183
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:13:49.113 --> 00:13:50.783
You didn't know what she went through.

00:13:51.053 --> 00:13:52.553
Anyone would've done the same.

00:13:53.453 --> 00:13:54.823
I was the same way.

00:13:55.453 --> 00:13:57.123
Even though I was living with her,

00:13:57.423 --> 00:13:59.593
I had no idea she had Alzheimer's.

00:14:01.763 --> 00:14:03.633
If anyone's a bad child, it's me.

00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:09.363
But at least we know now.

00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:13.103
From now on, let's put Mom's mind at ease.

00:14:14.003 --> 00:14:15.003
Okay?

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.713
With Mom,

00:14:19.413 --> 00:14:22.713
it's probably best not to let on, right?

00:14:24.883 --> 00:14:27.453
Having to show us that she's sick and weak...

00:14:28.183 --> 00:14:29.483
will be devastating for her.

00:14:31.253 --> 00:14:32.293
Got it.

00:14:33.153 --> 00:14:34.163
I will.

00:14:36.563 --> 00:14:39.263
Shouldn't we tell Mom, though?

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:41.633
About Kim Do Hee's car accident...

00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:43.873
It wasn't Mom's fault.

00:14:45.073 --> 00:14:46.203
We will.

00:14:47.003 --> 00:14:50.073
I'll tell her everything on one of her more lucid days.

00:14:54.383 --> 00:14:55.413
Seung Woo.

00:14:56.343 --> 00:14:58.353
You need to think rationally from now on.

00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:02.323
We must show no weakness to Hwang Gi Chan or Kang Se Ri.

00:15:02.823 --> 00:15:06.253
If they see an opening, they're the kind who'll exploit it.

00:15:07.393 --> 00:15:08.393
I understand.

00:15:09.193 --> 00:15:10.393
I'll try.

00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:24.073
Mr. Hwang Gi Man.

00:15:24.443 --> 00:15:25.973
Can we talk for a minute?

00:15:36.783 --> 00:15:38.893
Why did you give me soapy water to drink?

00:15:40.423 --> 00:15:42.023
It's floral tea, not soapy water.

00:15:42.523 --> 00:15:44.193
That's why it smells like flowers.

00:15:45.163 --> 00:15:48.603
Flowers suit a princess, so you should drink it.

00:15:50.603 --> 00:15:52.973
Want to know what I like?

00:15:53.373 --> 00:15:57.143
I like chocolate milk, all kinds of ice cream,

00:15:57.343 --> 00:15:58.973
and for snacks, I like anything chocolate.

00:15:59.343 --> 00:16:00.513
What about you, Princess?

00:16:00.843 --> 00:16:02.513
Do you like choco milk, Princess?

00:16:03.113 --> 00:16:06.583
My mom always drinks coffee milk after going to the bathhouse.

00:16:06.713 --> 00:16:08.683
Do you drink coffee-flavoured milk, Princess?

00:16:10.083 --> 00:16:11.253
Hwang Gi Man,

00:16:11.693 --> 00:16:13.353
listen to me carefully.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.923
I need you to focus.

00:16:16.663 --> 00:16:17.993
Okay.

00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:22.203
You may not remember, but we were once married.

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:26.533
We saw each other's best and worst, and we have already split up.

00:16:27.473 --> 00:16:30.913
We broke up? Why?

00:16:32.673 --> 00:16:36.343
What's the point of dredging up the past?

00:16:37.713 --> 00:16:40.583
What's certain is we're divorced.

00:16:41.323 --> 00:16:42.623
A divorce is...

00:16:42.753 --> 00:16:46.823
when a couple who loved each other fall out of love.

00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:50.893
But I like you, Princess.

00:16:51.433 --> 00:16:52.933
I love you.

00:16:52.993 --> 00:16:56.163
Well, I don't. I can't return your feelings.

00:16:57.133 --> 00:16:58.133
Understand?

00:16:59.473 --> 00:17:01.043
But I don't.

00:17:01.743 --> 00:17:03.343
I don't get it.

00:17:03.873 --> 00:17:06.713
So stop standing around in front of my store.

00:17:07.213 --> 00:17:11.213
It's wrong to do something the person you like hates, right?

00:17:11.913 --> 00:17:16.153
I think at least the man you are now can understand that.

00:17:17.193 --> 00:17:21.993
Doing something the person I like hates...

00:17:23.163 --> 00:17:24.763
is a bad thing.

00:17:37.773 --> 00:17:41.043
What's this? Why am I getting this from the Prosecutor's Office?

00:17:43.513 --> 00:17:45.353
(Summons)

00:17:45.453 --> 00:17:46.953
(Case summary, required documents)

00:17:47.013 --> 00:17:48.423
(Notice of rights)

00:17:48.523 --> 00:17:50.123
(Seoul district prosecutors' office)

00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:05.103
I heard Asst. Manager Kang Seung Woo hit you.

00:18:05.173 --> 00:18:07.743
You must've done something, right?

00:18:08.143 --> 00:18:09.143
Get out.

00:18:09.243 --> 00:18:13.273
Come on. He wouldn't hit you for no reason.

00:18:13.783 --> 00:18:15.483
I said to get out!

00:18:15.913 --> 00:18:18.553
This is the office. Don't cross the line.

00:18:20.413 --> 00:18:21.753
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:18:21.823 --> 00:18:26.353
Honey, we're in huge trouble. I was summoned by the prosecutors.

00:18:30.063 --> 00:18:33.763
What happened to your face? Did you get into a fight?

00:18:33.903 --> 00:18:36.363
It's nothing. Just say what you came to say.

00:18:38.073 --> 00:18:39.303
Look at this.

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:41.873
You got one too?

00:18:43.173 --> 00:18:44.713
What are we going to do now?

00:18:46.943 --> 00:18:48.083
Don't worry about it.

00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:53.153
How can I not worry? What if there's more than a witness?

00:18:53.213 --> 00:18:55.253
They're summoning both of us for questioning.

00:18:56.183 --> 00:18:57.393
Isn't that strange?

00:18:57.723 --> 00:18:59.553
There's a recording of the accident.

00:18:59.923 --> 00:19:01.493
Your voice is on it.

00:19:02.563 --> 00:19:05.893
- How is that possible? - A cell phone.

00:19:06.863 --> 00:19:11.733
Your voice was recorded on the phone of the person she was talking to.

00:19:11.803 --> 00:19:13.973
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:19:14.543 --> 00:19:16.003
Isn't this a setup?

00:19:16.673 --> 00:19:17.873
The recording alone...

00:19:18.573 --> 00:19:21.443
can't prove we killed Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee.

00:19:22.113 --> 00:19:23.713
From what I remember,

00:19:23.813 --> 00:19:26.453
we never said anything about killing her.

00:19:27.013 --> 00:19:30.322
But still, they know we were at the scene.

00:19:30.323 --> 00:19:32.923
No. We just have to deny it.

00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.063
In court, they need hard evidence.

00:19:36.623 --> 00:19:38.263
The audio file won't be enough.

00:19:39.433 --> 00:19:42.633
So, I guess we'll just deny it, like you said.

00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:44.633
Exactly. So, act like you don't know anything...

00:19:45.103 --> 00:19:46.973
as you've been doing,

00:19:47.543 --> 00:19:49.103
Don't do anything rash.

00:19:49.203 --> 00:19:51.873
Okay. I'm counting on you.

00:19:52.813 --> 00:19:54.083
Let's take a look.

00:20:14.003 --> 00:20:17.873
So it's clear Jae In's mother's car didn't hit her.

00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:22.743
Yes. I think the car startled her, and Do Hee fell on her own.

00:20:23.403 --> 00:20:25.243
From the driver Choi Ja Young's perspective,

00:20:25.513 --> 00:20:28.683
since Kim Do Hee collapsed right in front of her,

00:20:28.843 --> 00:20:31.853
she would have naturally assumed she caused the accident.

00:20:31.983 --> 00:20:33.013
Yes.

00:20:33.383 --> 00:20:34.783
It happened so fast,

00:20:35.483 --> 00:20:37.393
and it was pouring rain.

00:20:37.853 --> 00:20:40.593
Apparently, this video file was edited too.

00:20:41.263 --> 00:20:43.723
Why they would bother to send an edited video of the accident...

00:20:44.633 --> 00:20:46.063
is crystal clear now.

00:20:46.393 --> 00:20:49.733
We need to submit this footage to prosecutors as evidence now.

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:53.803
Yes, and that will definitely clear your mother's name, Jae In,

00:20:54.073 --> 00:20:56.943
and the reinvestigation will kick into high gear.

00:20:57.613 --> 00:21:00.043
Jae In. Now, for Ja Young...

00:21:01.613 --> 00:21:05.183
I think it's time you told your mother the truth.

00:21:25.833 --> 00:21:26.903
Mom.

00:21:27.773 --> 00:21:30.473
You didn't hit Kim Do Hee with your car.

00:21:31.113 --> 00:21:32.273
Really?

00:21:33.013 --> 00:21:34.113
It wasn't me?

00:21:34.913 --> 00:21:35.943
Really?

00:21:36.513 --> 00:21:37.783
I didn't do it?

00:21:39.483 --> 00:21:40.823
It was a close call,

00:21:42.453 --> 00:21:44.393
but you didn't do it, Mom.

00:21:44.853 --> 00:21:48.223
The forensic video expert confirmed it wasn't you.

00:21:52.693 --> 00:21:56.933
Ja Young, you've been through so much.

00:21:58.573 --> 00:22:00.773
Now you can put it all behind you.

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:05.913
I guess secrets never stay buried.

00:22:06.443 --> 00:22:07.913
This is another reminder of that.

00:22:16.483 --> 00:22:18.053
What a relief.

00:22:18.993 --> 00:22:20.453
Such a relief.

00:22:22.163 --> 00:22:24.393
I'm so relieved it wasn't me.

00:22:52.293 --> 00:22:53.653
So...

00:22:55.263 --> 00:22:58.493
you're saying that Jae In's mother didn't cause Do Hee's death,

00:22:58.893 --> 00:23:02.803
and the video proves it for certain?

00:23:03.103 --> 00:23:04.133
Yes.

00:23:04.533 --> 00:23:07.703
We fell for the trap set by Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

00:23:08.403 --> 00:23:11.373
They're worse than I ever thought.

00:23:11.873 --> 00:23:13.273
If we didn't have that evidence,

00:23:13.373 --> 00:23:17.013
we would have framed an innocent person for murder.

00:23:19.413 --> 00:23:21.753
Imagine how frustrated Do Hee must have been watching us.

00:23:23.783 --> 00:23:26.353
Mother, are you all right?

00:23:28.393 --> 00:23:31.533
Like Oh Seong said, we almost became the villains in this.

00:23:33.163 --> 00:23:37.233
We almost let an innocent person rot in prison for the rest of her life.

00:23:39.273 --> 00:23:40.603
Does Jae In's mother know yet?

00:23:41.103 --> 00:23:43.473
Yes. Jae In said she was going to tell her today.

00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:47.273
She must have felt so wronged.

00:23:47.913 --> 00:23:51.953
At least we know the truth now. Yun Hee, don't be too upset.

00:23:53.383 --> 00:23:56.883
Do Yun, you know we can't just let this slide, right?

00:23:57.453 --> 00:24:00.893
To ensure this never happens again, you must tell the world the truth.

00:24:01.693 --> 00:24:04.462
Of course. I'll make sure everyone knows.

00:24:04.463 --> 00:24:08.933
We absolutely have to. We must make an example of them.

00:24:09.063 --> 00:24:10.933
Yes. We must.

00:24:11.803 --> 00:24:13.033
We absolutely will.

00:24:17.043 --> 00:24:21.383
As new evidence comes to light in the YL Group's Kim Do Hee case,

00:24:21.483 --> 00:24:23.913
the case has taken a surprise turn.

00:24:24.253 --> 00:24:25.552
Thanks to new evidence,

00:24:25.553 --> 00:24:28.482
YL Group's late Chairman Kang's wife, Choi Ja Young,

00:24:28.483 --> 00:24:29.853
has been exonerated.

00:24:30.383 --> 00:24:33.092
The prosecution will review the past investigation...

00:24:33.093 --> 00:24:34.822
and new evidence...

00:24:34.823 --> 00:24:36.522
to ensure no questions are left unanswered.

00:24:36.523 --> 00:24:38.993
They have also stated that they will conduct a thorough reinvestigation.

00:24:43.133 --> 00:24:47.233
Hey, Gi Chan, what's going on with all this?

00:24:47.773 --> 00:24:49.903
Are we really just going to let this happen?

00:24:51.013 --> 00:24:52.843
It's just news that she's innocent.

00:24:53.273 --> 00:24:54.813
What does that have to do with me?

00:24:55.783 --> 00:24:57.283
They'll catch some other culprit, I guess.

00:24:58.383 --> 00:25:01.153
Don't worry about it. I'm heading to work.

00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:07.023
He's right, Mother. No one knows about it,

00:25:07.253 --> 00:25:08.463
except for us.

00:25:09.823 --> 00:25:11.063
I'm heading out, too.

00:25:12.663 --> 00:25:13.963
Why that...

00:25:24.473 --> 00:25:26.873
I just don't understand life sometimes.

00:25:28.613 --> 00:25:30.683
This is just too cruel a twist of fate.

00:25:31.853 --> 00:25:35.153
Is this about what you heard about Kang Seung Woo?

00:25:36.053 --> 00:25:37.283
Yes.

00:25:37.753 --> 00:25:40.353
It's shocking that he has a grown son,

00:25:40.693 --> 00:25:42.463
and he wasn't raised by just anyone.

00:25:42.563 --> 00:25:43.792
To think he was raised...

00:25:43.793 --> 00:25:45.793
in YL Group's family as Jae In's brother.

00:25:47.293 --> 00:25:51.103
Kang Seung Woo still doesn't know about Oh Seong.

00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:53.302
I heard he also...

00:25:53.303 --> 00:25:55.203
recently found out Director Kang Mi Ran was his biological mother,

00:25:55.273 --> 00:25:56.603
a woman he thought was his aunt.

00:25:58.243 --> 00:26:00.213
Yes, I heard all that.

00:26:00.773 --> 00:26:02.083
I heard, but...

00:26:02.713 --> 00:26:06.253
no matter what anyone says, I can't stand that Kang Mi Ran.

00:26:07.213 --> 00:26:10.783
Oh Seong was a complete wreck after she abandoned him.

00:26:12.353 --> 00:26:14.793
It's in the past, and your uncle, the one who went through it all,

00:26:15.063 --> 00:26:16.393
says he's okay.

00:26:16.523 --> 00:26:17.893
I tell myself to forget it, but...

00:26:18.333 --> 00:26:20.963
I think about Mi Sook... You know, Jae In's mother.

00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:25.273
I get furious all over again when I think of her.

00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:28.543
She's a victim in all this, too.

00:26:29.273 --> 00:26:31.573
All because of Kang Mi Ran and her high-and-mighty family.

00:26:32.943 --> 00:26:37.083
She lived so long without the truth. Her resentment must have festered.

00:26:38.713 --> 00:26:41.083
They completely toyed with her life.

00:26:42.423 --> 00:26:43.923
Every time I see her losing her mind,

00:26:44.653 --> 00:26:46.623
I can't help but feel wronged and furious on her behalf.

It's me. We need to talk.

What do you want?

00:27:54.123 --> 00:27:57.163
If this isn't about work, there is no need to meet privately.

00:27:58.263 --> 00:27:59.833
Why are you so on edge?

00:28:00.563 --> 00:28:01.563
I'm not.

00:28:02.903 --> 00:28:03.903
Seriously, what is this?

00:28:04.503 --> 00:28:05.973
Why did you ask to see me?

00:28:06.473 --> 00:28:08.843
I was in the area to meet someone, so I thought I could see you.

00:28:09.303 --> 00:28:10.303
Is there a problem with that?

00:28:11.573 --> 00:28:12.573
Are you kidding me?

00:28:13.813 --> 00:28:15.283
I'm only going to ask you this one last time.

00:28:17.313 --> 00:28:18.613
The baby you were carrying...

00:28:19.753 --> 00:28:20.853
Is the baby really dead?

00:28:23.823 --> 00:28:25.223
I already told you the baby died.

00:28:26.423 --> 00:28:28.463
What would I get out of lying to you?

00:28:29.593 --> 00:28:30.863
Let me make this perfectly clear.

00:28:31.493 --> 00:28:32.533
That baby...

00:28:33.533 --> 00:28:34.533
is dead.

00:28:39.473 --> 00:28:40.473
All right.

00:28:41.773 --> 00:28:43.443
Fine. That's it. That's all I wanted to ask.

00:28:48.113 --> 00:28:49.783
Don't you dare say anything to Gi Chan.

00:28:50.483 --> 00:28:53.713
What we had is ancient history.

00:28:56.423 --> 00:28:58.153
At least have that much decency.

00:28:58.553 --> 00:29:00.593
Like you said, it was already over between us,

00:29:01.523 --> 00:29:03.593
and there's no child connecting us anymore,

00:29:04.463 --> 00:29:05.693
so what nonsense is there for me to say?

00:29:10.263 --> 00:29:11.373
Yes, hello?

00:29:12.073 --> 00:29:13.133
Oh, yes. I've just arrived.

00:29:31.253 --> 00:29:32.253
Excuse me.

00:29:32.653 --> 00:29:34.193
Are you Designer L?

00:29:36.163 --> 00:29:37.833
Yes, that's me.

00:29:38.593 --> 00:29:39.593
Hello.

00:29:42.063 --> 00:29:43.133
Kang Jae In?

00:29:44.573 --> 00:29:45.803
Do I know you?

00:29:47.873 --> 00:29:50.103
Your style has gotten so glamorous that I almost didn't recognise you.

00:29:50.973 --> 00:29:52.043
But it is you.

00:29:52.913 --> 00:29:54.843
Gosh, I'm sorry.

00:29:55.083 --> 00:29:58.083
I'm having trouble placing you.

00:30:07.653 --> 00:30:10.063
Success is the fortune of those who never give up.

00:30:10.763 --> 00:30:11.793
Best of luck.

00:30:13.463 --> 00:30:15.963
That's what my father always used to say.

00:30:18.833 --> 00:30:20.133
The LA Getty Center?

00:30:20.833 --> 00:30:21.903
It's been eight years, hasn't it?

00:30:23.673 --> 00:30:26.473
Gosh, it's so good to see you.

00:30:29.483 --> 00:30:30.483
I'm Lee Tae Oh.

00:30:33.683 --> 00:30:36.083
As in, Lee Tae Oh, the art dealer?

00:30:37.223 --> 00:30:38.223
That's me.

00:30:39.393 --> 00:30:41.193
To think that Designer L is Kang Jae In...

00:30:42.023 --> 00:30:43.523
I never would have imagined.

00:30:45.263 --> 00:30:47.563
I could say the same.

00:30:50.203 --> 00:30:51.203
Lee Tae Oh,

00:30:52.403 --> 00:30:53.803
I've been looking for you.

00:30:56.203 --> 00:30:57.973
I've been looking for you too, Kang Jae In.

00:31:04.243 --> 00:31:05.283
Everyone, say hello.

00:31:05.553 --> 00:31:06.883
This is Lee Tae Oh, the art dealer.

00:31:07.253 --> 00:31:10.083
This is our CEO, Jung Oh Seong, and Director Kim Do Yun.

00:31:10.983 --> 00:31:12.023
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:31:12.453 --> 00:31:13.623
Lee Tae Oh?

00:31:15.223 --> 00:31:17.323
Wait, then... Do you know Andy Rogers, by any chance?

00:31:17.663 --> 00:31:19.833
He's a major super-collector.

00:31:20.393 --> 00:31:21.463
Of course.

00:31:21.733 --> 00:31:24.463
He's a long time patron and a special VIP of mine.

00:31:25.233 --> 00:31:28.873
Are you Patrick, by any chance? Rogers insisted we meet tomorrow.

00:31:29.273 --> 00:31:30.843
Yes, that's me.

00:31:32.113 --> 00:31:34.213
Fancy meeting you here. It's a pleasure.

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:38.213
So you two already knew each other?

00:31:38.613 --> 00:31:41.622
We met long ago in the States,

00:31:41.623 --> 00:31:43.123
but I didn't know he was a top art dealer.

00:31:43.653 --> 00:31:45.153
It's all thanks to Jae In.

00:31:45.323 --> 00:31:47.293
To me, she's my "destiny?"

00:31:48.063 --> 00:31:49.263
How do you say that in Korean?

00:31:49.723 --> 00:31:50.723
Fate.

00:31:50.993 --> 00:31:52.563
That's right. Fate.

00:31:54.133 --> 00:31:56.003
She is like fate to me.

00:32:02.603 --> 00:32:03.973
Come on, have a seat.

00:32:06.173 --> 00:32:08.983
Jae In mentioned you had a reason for looking for me.

00:32:11.913 --> 00:32:14.313
We wanted to ask you something about your younger sister.

00:32:15.853 --> 00:32:18.553
We heard her name is Catherine.

00:32:20.753 --> 00:32:21.763
That's correct.

00:32:25.733 --> 00:32:28.463
We heard she went missing a long time ago.

00:32:29.763 --> 00:32:31.373
Yes... How did you know that?

00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:33.703
Do you know my sister, Catherine?

00:32:36.403 --> 00:32:39.313
By any chance, is this person's name...

00:32:40.373 --> 00:32:41.613
Catherine?

00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:39.633
(Queen's House)

00:33:39.703 --> 00:33:41.703
- Ms. Kang! - Bo Ram!

00:33:43.473 --> 00:33:44.473
Have you been waiting long?

00:33:45.013 --> 00:33:46.373
No, I just came down.

00:33:46.773 --> 00:33:47.773
I'm so sorry.

00:33:48.043 --> 00:33:51.343
For everything I said and did to Do Hee.

00:33:52.253 --> 00:33:53.613
I know I can't take any of it back...

00:33:54.213 --> 00:33:55.683
or any way to undo it.

00:33:55.823 --> 00:33:57.783
For as long as you're my mom,

00:33:59.093 --> 00:34:03.793
Ms. Choi Ja Young will still be a mother of mine.

00:34:04.193 --> 00:34:05.993
But I wanted to call you this today.

00:34:06.993 --> 00:34:08.033
Thank you,

00:34:08.963 --> 00:34:09.963
Mom.

00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:11.602
Hwang Ji Ho.

00:34:11.603 --> 00:34:13.933
How long were you going to hide my son from me?
