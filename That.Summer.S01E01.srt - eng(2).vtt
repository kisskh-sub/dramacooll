00:00:41.698 --> 00:00:43.065
Davin has graduated.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.613
In no more than three months,

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.715
I think I'll hold a ceremony

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.592
to officially name him heir to the throne.

00:00:54.157 --> 00:00:56.179
Don't you think it's a bit too soon,
Your Majesty?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.632
Maybe the prince

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.579
should be more prepared first.

00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:05.489
But I still want to learn more.

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:09.076
What your father said was right.

00:01:09.553 --> 00:01:10.562
I'm not ready yet.

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:13.194
I just want to travel without attendants,

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:14.485
to live freely in a place

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:16.524
where I can be someone else,

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:20.431
somewhere I don't have to be a prince.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.686
But I can't tell Father and Mother.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.452
They wouldn't want an heir
who strays from tradition.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.550
Others may not accept you,

00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:28.567
but you must learn to accept yourself first.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.501
Can you keep a secret, Victor?

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:32.221
We grew up together.

00:01:32.743 --> 00:01:33.887
You can trust me.

00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:41.031
What do you mean by being like that?

00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:41.934
A prince who likes men.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:42.593
It's my duty anyway.

00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:43.192
What are you afraid of?

00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:44.229
I love you, Davin,

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.480
no matter who you are.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:48.528
I'll run away to travel in Thailand.

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.033
Hey?

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:54.929
Hey?

00:01:57.473 --> 00:01:58.260
Are you alright?

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.392
BANGKOK, THAILAND

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:18.730
Cheers!

00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:19.743
Cheers!

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:22.332
Hey, dude!

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.381
ARANTA

00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:42.508
Davin!

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:44.848
Sister!

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:48.940
Where are you going?

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:52.404
And why are you carrying a bag
at this hour of the night?

00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:06.986
Hey, wanna hit it?

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.787
Nope, you go ahead.

00:03:09.992 --> 00:03:11.130
I'll just stick to booze.

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:12.732
Fine. Up to you.

00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:14.725
But if you change your mind, join in.

00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:15.999
Alright.

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:16.828
Let's go, guys.

00:03:25.935 --> 00:03:27.125
Hey, Davin.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:27.924
Hold on!

00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:29.207
Davin.

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:30.591
Where are you taking me?

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:32.726
Davin!

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:33.368
Anya, hurry up!

00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:34.445
Davin, wait.

00:03:37.534 --> 00:03:38.260
Hey.

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:41.637
Davin, what are you playing?

00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:42.524
Tell me right now!

00:03:44.614 --> 00:03:46.463
I'm going to Thailand with Victor.

00:03:46.463 --> 00:03:47.703
Why are you going?

00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:50.118
Why run off like this?

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.520
I just want to live my life

00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:55.273
before I don't have a chance to.

00:03:56.522 --> 00:03:58.243
Why don't you just tell Father and Mother?

00:03:58.243 --> 00:03:59.803
They could take care of it for you.

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:02.781
You know

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:05.371
I'll never get to go the way I want.

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.179
There'll be an entourage
tailing me the whole time.

00:04:11.858 --> 00:04:13.167
But I can't let you go.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:15.533
It's too dangerous.

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:18.474
Come on, get inside.

00:04:20.382 --> 00:04:21.134
Hey!

00:04:21.838 --> 00:04:23.171
Please, I'm begging you.

00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:25.688
Just give me one month.

00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:29.401
Then I'll come back
and be the heir Father wants.

00:04:31.082 --> 00:04:31.936
Please.

00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:51.678
But take good care of yourself.

00:04:51.678 --> 00:04:53.653
Keep me updated all the time.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.485
And hurry back
to being the prince of Aranta.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.816
Got it?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.839
Got it?

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:01.895
Got it.

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:03.241
Come here.

00:05:04.536 --> 00:05:05.971
Take care of yourself.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.100
Yeah.

00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:11.403
I worry about you so much, you know?

00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:14.289
Now go.

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:20.612
Princess Anya.

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:22.553
Is something wrong?

00:05:22.894 --> 00:05:25.001
I heard a phone ringing out here.

00:05:25.796 --> 00:05:28.947
Oh, I was just taking a call.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.516
The night air feels nice.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.051
Winter came early this year.

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:35.602
Yes, and the moon's beautiful too.

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:38.039
Mhm.

00:05:45.648 --> 00:05:46.620
I want to go to bed now.

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:47.945
Walk me back.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:49.189
Sure.

00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:05.967
I thought
you wouldn't be brave enough to come.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.803
Someone like me must get to do
what I want to do.

00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.263
Quickly get in
before someone sees us.

00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:37.137
Hey.

00:06:38.808 --> 00:06:39.439
Hey!

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.826
Hey, don't mess with me!

00:06:41.053 --> 00:06:42.493
I told you I don't like you.

00:06:42.697 --> 00:06:43.753
Go find someone else.

00:06:44.048 --> 00:06:45.425
Why are you playing so hard to get, huh?

00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:47.206
I told you not to mess with me!

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:48.142
What?!

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.049
Hey.

00:06:49.853 --> 00:06:51.239
If she isn't interested,

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:52.465
then just let her be.

00:06:52.465 --> 00:06:53.748
Why are you sticking your nose in?

00:06:53.862 --> 00:06:55.109
Are you her husband or what?

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:56.261
I'm not her husband,

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.425
but she's not interested in you.

00:06:58.925 --> 00:07:00.366
Go home and jerk off then.

00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:01.069
Asshole!

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:01.771
Got some nerve, huh?

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:03.842
You want it, huh?!

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.172
Come on, take it!

00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:20.109
I'm picking up my son.

00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:21.570
Just a moment, please.

00:07:45.868 --> 00:07:47.840
Why do you always cause trouble, huh?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.784
Are you rebelling against me?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.061
That's up to you then, Mom.

00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:53.360
I'm a problem anyway.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.971
I'll send you to your uncle
in the south for three months.

00:08:02.493 --> 00:08:03.243
I'm not going.

00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:05.676
Why do I have to go?!

00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:07.340
Because you got suspended!

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:10.280
Your clip getting busted by the cops
is all over the internet.

00:08:10.643 --> 00:08:13.841
And the news is damaging your father's reputation during the election.

00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:15.085
He's not my father!

00:08:17.175 --> 00:08:18.075
In the end,

00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:20.397
you're all only looking out for yourselves.

00:08:20.397 --> 00:08:22.573
I've done everything I could to help you.

00:08:22.573 --> 00:08:24.041
You have to help me too.

00:08:24.314 --> 00:08:27.741
How can this kind of thing set a good example for your younger brother?

00:08:31.352 --> 00:08:35.397
No one's going to want me
in this house anyway.

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:38.636
Happy new family.

00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:51.302
I want to return it to you,

00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:53.136
but your dad already sold it to me.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.110
I got it, Uncle.

00:08:56.496 --> 00:08:57.451
But back then,

00:08:57.678 --> 00:08:59.115
my dad probably needed the money.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.292
I just wanted to see if it's still the same.

00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:03.975
Don't worry at all.

00:09:04.248 --> 00:09:05.607
I've been taking good care of it,

00:09:06.243 --> 00:09:07.359
waiting for you to get it back.

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:12.913
Why didn't you just ask your mom and stepdad for the money to buy it back?

00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:13.969
They're rich, aren't they?

00:09:14.332 --> 00:09:15.103
I won't, Uncle.

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:17.655
Their money is theirs.

00:09:17.655 --> 00:09:18.333
I'm not involved.

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:23.151
Alright, here's the deal.

00:09:24.173 --> 00:09:26.072
I'll give you the key to keep.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.894
Whenever you've worked
and saved up enough,

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.669
you can take it.

00:09:30.577 --> 00:09:31.255
Seriously?

00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:32.216
Yeah.

00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:34.549
Just make sure you get the money.

00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.611
I'm just waiting to return it
to its rightful owner.

00:10:55.553 --> 00:11:00.510
BANGSAWAN ISLAND, THAILAND

00:11:47.218 --> 00:11:48.039
Are you okay?

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.639
Seasick, huh?

00:12:06.621 --> 00:12:07.650
I think so.

00:12:08.536 --> 00:12:10.021
It's my first time on a boat.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.701
I guess I'm feeling seasick.

00:12:13.155 --> 00:12:14.421
If you know you get seasick,

00:12:15.057 --> 00:12:16.695
take a motion sickness pill beforehand.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.471
Take mine.

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:25.392
Take it for the return trip.

00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:34.695
Come on.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.472
This is a motion sickness pill,

00:12:36.654 --> 00:12:37.806
not some party drug.

00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:39.143
Take it.

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:43.209
Hey!

00:12:43.209 --> 00:12:43.709
Ouch!

00:12:54.634 --> 00:12:55.478
Ugh!!

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:02.400
Shit!

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.960
Hey, I'm sorry.

00:13:05.528 --> 00:13:06.758
Your shirt is stained.

00:13:07.962 --> 00:13:09.200
I'll take care of it.

00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:10.343
How much do I owe you?

00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:11.364
Tell me.

00:13:11.364 --> 00:13:12.111
No need!

00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:13.862
I can just wipe it off.

00:13:14.725 --> 00:13:15.765
But I can really take responsibility.

00:13:16.424 --> 00:13:17.232
How much would you like?

00:13:17.232 --> 00:13:17.869
Tell me.

00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:19.123
Why are you so rich, huh?

00:13:20.554 --> 00:13:21.287
Never mind.

00:13:21.764 --> 00:13:22.941
I don't hold it against someone weak.

00:13:25.916 --> 00:13:27.419
Why are you calling me weak?

00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:30.140
I just got seasick.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.428
Ah, whatever!

00:13:36.427 --> 00:13:38.581
Helping anyone just brings me nothing
but damn trouble.

00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:40.733
It's all on me!

00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:41.841
Damn it!

00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:45.241
Ugh!

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.151
Tum, you finished scrubbing the boat yet?

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:21.021
Done, Chief.

00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:22.626
How was the fishing trip this time?

00:14:22.626 --> 00:14:23.671
I caught a lot,

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:26.754
and even got another one just now.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.085
Uncle Peng, right?

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:32.755
Yeah, me.

00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:37.083
Lava, don't you remember me?

00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:39.803
How could I?

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.236
I only saw you when I was a kid.

00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:42.750
Then you ran off to the island.

00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:44.986
His mom called me.

00:14:48.324 --> 00:14:49.740
I've heard you've been a menace?

00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:50.900
Sort of, yeah.

00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:54.555
What the fuck is that terrible smell?!

00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:57.415
Hey, is your shirt covered in puke?

00:14:57.824 --> 00:14:59.210
Just riding a boat, and you got seasick?

00:14:59.596 --> 00:15:00.737
You wimp!

00:15:00.737 --> 00:15:01.554
I didn't puke.

00:15:01.872 --> 00:15:02.925
Someone else did.

00:15:03.288 --> 00:15:04.656
Then why didn't you change your shirt?

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.621
Or do you like smelling puke?

00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:11.502
We're just kidding.

00:15:12.887 --> 00:15:13.730
This is Tum.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.977
He'll train you on the jobs here.

00:15:16.954 --> 00:15:17.630
Jobs?

00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:19.878
The ones you have to do for me.

00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:22.714
No free ride here.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.748
Even if you're my nephew,

00:15:24.998 --> 00:15:26.330
you'll have to work.

00:15:27.852 --> 00:15:28.484
Will I get paid?

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:30.374
Don't worry about money.

00:15:30.965 --> 00:15:32.567
Just do the work well.

00:15:33.657 --> 00:15:34.393
Get moving already.

00:15:34.711 --> 00:15:36.507
There's still a lot you need to learn.

00:15:40.186 --> 00:15:42.304
Welcome to island life.

00:15:45.484 --> 00:15:46.888
This summer is going to be rough.

00:15:48.523 --> 00:15:49.459
Close the tailgate.

00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:57.707
Hey, hurry the hell up!

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:58.988
You're wasting my time.

00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:00.213
Stop dragging your feet.

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:03.663
Close the tailgate!

00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:20.306
7 DAYS LATER

00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:26.014
Lava, wake up.

00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:31.487
It's 5 a.m.

00:16:31.487 --> 00:16:31.991
Wake up!

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:32.491
Ugh.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.315
Uncle, what's with you?

00:16:37.834 --> 00:16:39.362
5 a.m. is bedtime!

00:16:39.562 --> 00:16:40.926
At home, maybe.

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.899
Here, we go out on the boat to set the nets.

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:44.326
No need to shower.

00:16:44.326 --> 00:16:45.729
Just wash your face and brush your teeth.

00:16:45.849 --> 00:16:46.794
I'll be waiting downstairs.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.960
Fine!

00:17:00.084 --> 00:17:01.279
Lava, get up!

00:17:26.902 --> 00:17:28.021
Lava, wake up!

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.351
I brought you here to fish,
not to sleep.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.045
Don't be too hard on your nephew, Chief.

00:17:33.045 --> 00:17:33.833
He's not used to it yet.

00:17:33.933 --> 00:17:35.114
He should get used to it already.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:37.205
This is your life for months.

00:17:38.863 --> 00:17:39.520
Fine, fine.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.960
I'm awake now.

00:17:46.051 --> 00:17:46.757
Chief.

00:18:02.338 --> 00:18:04.815
Uncle? What did you do?!

00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:05.827
Woke up, huh?

00:18:05.827 --> 00:18:07.261
If you're awake, go haul the net.

00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:08.232
You've been here a week.

00:18:08.232 --> 00:18:09.321
You should know the job by now.

00:18:09.528 --> 00:18:10.761
I'm up, I'm up!

00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:12.224
You don't have to go this far!

00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:13.344
Geez.

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:17.641
My maid ran off with her guy.

00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.400
So you wash my clothes for me, okay?

00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:21.410
Separate the whites from the colors.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:23.488
If colors bleed, I'll dock your pay.

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:39.774
Ugh!

00:18:45.464 --> 00:18:47.539
Hey, hey.

00:18:48.118 --> 00:18:49.492
Don't destroy stuff.

00:18:53.725 --> 00:18:55.147
I've been up since 5 a.m.,

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:56.919
and have been working until now.

00:18:57.598 --> 00:18:58.673
This isn't the chill life I thought.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:00.675
You'd better get used to it.

00:19:01.094 --> 00:19:03.744
With Chief, it only gets tougher.

00:19:03.984 --> 00:19:04.889
No chill life, dude.

00:19:14.377 --> 00:19:15.474
But I can tell

00:19:16.632 --> 00:19:18.433
what a Bangkok kid

00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:20.552
stranded on an island like you wants.

00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:35.001
You got the good stuff?

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.190
You asked the right guy, buddy.

00:19:41.546 --> 00:19:43.775
Come on, I'll take you to heaven.

00:19:56.207 --> 00:19:58.460
Fuck, this feels so good!

00:20:05.168 --> 00:20:07.338
Don't let Chief find out
about smoking weed.

00:20:07.338 --> 00:20:08.467
He fucking hates it.

00:20:08.806 --> 00:20:10.220
He almost got me fired last time.

00:20:10.979 --> 00:20:12.221
Why the hell would I tell him?

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.411
I won't.

00:20:14.489 --> 00:20:16.581
So how'd you end up here with Uncle Peng?

00:20:18.139 --> 00:20:19.717
I dropped out, dumb as a rock.

00:20:19.897 --> 00:20:20.741
Chief is a kind man.

00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:21.969
He saw I had no future,

00:20:21.969 --> 00:20:23.037
so he taught me the ropes.

00:20:24.195 --> 00:20:25.395
‘Kind' my ass.

00:20:25.714 --> 00:20:26.840
He's as strict as my mom.

00:20:29.096 --> 00:20:30.315
You'll get used to it, man.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.474
You know what? I want to be an influencer.

00:20:39.469 --> 00:20:41.018
Who are you to influence anyone?

00:20:42.216 --> 00:20:43.436
Asshole.

00:20:43.616 --> 00:20:46.212
Hey, check my style, man.

00:20:46.212 --> 00:20:47.233
I'm bad-boy vibes.

00:20:47.732 --> 00:20:49.644
At least the biker kids follow me.

00:20:52.998 --> 00:20:54.028
Looking down on me, huh?

00:20:54.028 --> 00:20:55.855
Film me for TikTok, will you?

00:20:56.374 --> 00:21:00.975
Shit. Views have been dead lately.

00:21:01.374 --> 00:21:02.387
What should I do?

00:21:02.487 --> 00:21:04.280
Strip and dance?

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.182
Joint!

00:21:05.442 --> 00:21:06.119
Joint!

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:06.692
Shit.

00:21:06.692 --> 00:21:08.059
You almost got the joint in the shot, dude.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:08.907
Come on.

00:21:10.444 --> 00:21:11.527
I'm just warming up first.

00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:14.002
You don't need to strip.

00:21:14.641 --> 00:21:15.363
Just keep posting.

00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:16.069
The views will come.

00:21:16.069 --> 00:21:17.236
Alright.

00:21:18.574 --> 00:21:20.412
Eh, your mom's calling.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.377
Damn, she's interrupting everything.

00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:25.200
Why is she calling?

00:21:27.017 --> 00:21:27.650
What's up, Mom?

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.178
(Where the hell are you, Tum?)

00:21:29.178 --> 00:21:31.588
(Weren't you going to pick me up
at the market?)

00:21:32.027 --> 00:21:34.440
Okay, Mom, I'll hurry.

00:21:36.257 --> 00:21:37.516
Damn it, I have to go first.

00:21:37.716 --> 00:21:40.045
I forgot I had to pick up Mom at the market.

00:21:40.241 --> 00:21:41.772
-Alright.
-You stay here. I'll be back.

00:21:41.772 --> 00:21:42.272
Alright.

00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:43.921
Don't smoke it all, alright?

00:21:43.921 --> 00:21:44.941
Can I leave it with you, huh?

00:21:44.941 --> 00:21:46.712
Fine. I'm good with just one.

00:21:46.712 --> 00:21:48.002
I'll just chill in the sea.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:51.109
Seriously, man, don't finish it all yourself.

00:21:51.428 --> 00:21:52.184
I'm off, dude!

00:21:52.184 --> 00:21:52.738
Fine.

00:21:52.838 --> 00:21:54.263
Shoes, Tum!

00:21:54.263 --> 00:21:54.949
Shit.

00:21:56.886 --> 00:21:58.241
I'm off. Take care of it for me.

00:21:58.241 --> 00:21:58.933
Yeah.

00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:36.436
Hey!

00:22:42.887 --> 00:22:43.561
Hey!

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.440
Hey!

00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:45.788
Help!

00:22:45.788 --> 00:22:46.857
Help!

00:22:46.857 --> 00:22:47.767
Someone's drowning!

00:22:48.126 --> 00:22:48.721
Hey!?

00:22:56.414 --> 00:22:57.081
What should I do?

00:23:20.361 --> 00:23:20.861
Ouch!

00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:26.456
Hey, what's with you?!

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.181
What the hell happened?

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.362
Tum! Help! He's drowning.

00:23:39.362 --> 00:23:40.204
Shit. Hurry!

00:23:40.204 --> 00:23:41.330
Take him to the hospital now!

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.762
One, two, three!

00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:48.834
Help! He's drowning!

00:23:49.393 --> 00:23:50.790
Tum, help lift him!

00:23:52.528 --> 00:23:54.162
Help! He's drowning!

00:23:54.481 --> 00:23:55.418
Pull him up!

00:23:56.296 --> 00:23:57.343
Bro, help.

00:23:57.343 --> 00:23:58.053
Pull him up!

00:23:58.053 --> 00:23:58.940
Go, go, go!

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.262
Shit. Will he make it?

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:10.559
I don't know. We did all we could.

00:24:13.634 --> 00:24:14.665
Man, he's in bad shape.

00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:19.019
Doc.

00:24:19.838 --> 00:24:21.879
Are you the two
who brought the drowning guy?

00:24:22.977 --> 00:24:23.917
I was the one who found him.

00:24:25.774 --> 00:24:27.282
Are you Chief Peng's nephew?

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.215
Yes.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.482
Ah, I forgot to introduce him.

00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:34.956
This is Dr. Wut,

00:24:35.335 --> 00:24:36.497
the hottest doctor on the island.

00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:38.534
Say hello to him.

00:24:39.752 --> 00:24:40.854
And this is Lava,

00:24:41.333 --> 00:24:42.427
a clean-cut young man from Bangkok.

00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:43.822
He's handsome,

00:24:44.701 --> 00:24:45.489
but not as much as me.

00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.561
How's the patient, Doc?

00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:54.046
He's out of danger.

00:24:55.364 --> 00:24:57.217
Lucky you gave first aid.

00:24:57.317 --> 00:24:58.401
He wouldn't have made it otherwise.

00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:00.586
Wow, give him some credit.

00:25:01.065 --> 00:25:02.905
You look handsome now, huh?

00:25:02.905 --> 00:25:03.586
Cool.

00:25:03.905 --> 00:25:04.958
You did great.

00:25:05.238 --> 00:25:06.194
If he wakes up,

00:25:06.194 --> 00:25:08.715
he'll owe you big time for saving him.

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:13.028
I'm Kratae, the prettiest nurse on this island.

00:25:15.184 --> 00:25:16.985
There are five nurses here.

00:25:16.985 --> 00:25:18.490
Four are already moms.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.916
Of course, you're the prettiest.

00:25:20.675 --> 00:25:23.961
Tum, save your words for your sour curry.

00:25:24.168 --> 00:25:24.990
Do you want to eat together?

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.688
No way.

00:25:25.688 --> 00:25:28.357
Well, do you know who he is?

00:25:28.936 --> 00:25:30.205
He has no id card with him.

00:25:31.044 --> 00:25:32.355
He's probably a tourist.

00:25:32.874 --> 00:25:35.039
I met him on the boat last week.

00:25:35.518 --> 00:25:36.205
But he has a head injury.

00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:37.491
It looks like he was assaulted.

00:25:38.529 --> 00:25:40.025
We need to report it to the police
to find his family.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:13.601
Hey!

00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:14.321
Hey!

00:26:14.401 --> 00:26:15.052
Ouch!

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.843
Who are you?

00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:18.188
Fuck!

00:26:18.907 --> 00:26:20.001
Why the hell did you push me?

00:26:22.157 --> 00:26:23.569
I'm the one who saved you!

00:26:23.829 --> 00:26:24.532
Liar.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.350
Are you going to hurt me or what?!

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:27.076
Hurt you?

00:26:27.076 --> 00:26:27.885
Are you crazy?

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.214
Or are you here to steal something?

00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:36.665
I was going to give your stuff back.

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:41.018
I helped you

00:26:41.457 --> 00:26:42.238
and you just pushed me like that?!

00:26:47.234 --> 00:26:48.935
Hey, are you okay?

00:26:51.321 --> 00:26:52.046
Are you hurt?

00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:53.148
Don't!

00:26:53.288 --> 00:26:54.227
Don't hurt me!

00:26:54.227 --> 00:26:54.727
Hey!

00:26:54.727 --> 00:26:56.281
Don't! Don't hurt me!

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:57.603
- Don't!
- Wait, I'll call the doctor!

00:26:57.603 --> 00:26:59.907
- Doctor!
- Don't!

00:26:59.907 --> 00:27:00.925
Calm down, patient.

00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:01.843
Don't hurt me!

00:27:01.843 --> 00:27:03.090
- Don't!
- Come here first.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.107
Patient, relax.

00:27:04.107 --> 00:27:04.668
Relax.

00:27:05.027 --> 00:27:05.665
I'm here.

00:27:05.665 --> 00:27:07.123
Calm down.

00:27:10.241 --> 00:27:11.011
This is your doctor.

00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:24.169
The patient's initial assessment shows
a head trauma caused by physical assault,

00:27:24.548 --> 00:27:26.404
which resulted in partial memory loss.

00:27:26.923 --> 00:27:28.251
From my preliminary check,

00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:31.102
the patient can't remember who he is,

00:27:31.202 --> 00:27:32.082
what he did,

00:27:32.082 --> 00:27:33.029
or where he's from.

00:27:33.328 --> 00:27:36.419
Simply put, the incident the patient experienced may have been so severe

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:39.211
that the brain erased all of his memories.

00:27:40.241 --> 00:27:42.161
Dissociative amnesia, right, Doc?

00:27:42.834 --> 00:27:43.543
Yes.

00:27:44.402 --> 00:27:45.357
How did you know?

00:27:45.856 --> 00:27:46.356
Eh?

00:27:47.294 --> 00:27:49.339
I've got to have
some general knowledge, you know.

00:27:53.372 --> 00:27:54.573
So will he recover?

00:27:54.753 --> 00:27:56.607
When will he remember?

00:27:57.266 --> 00:27:58.125
I can't say for sure.

00:27:58.784 --> 00:27:59.980
It'll take time.

00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:02.645
For now, we need to treat
the physical injuries first.

00:28:02.645 --> 00:28:06.680
The mind and memory will take longer.

00:28:10.241 --> 00:28:11.022
What do we do now?

00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:14.431
This is happening in a place
with no one to watch over him.

00:28:17.126 --> 00:28:18.228
Thank you so much, Doc,

00:28:18.881 --> 00:28:19.679
for calling me.

00:28:24.564 --> 00:28:25.893
Credit goes to your nephew.

00:28:26.133 --> 00:28:27.014
He's the one who saved him.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:00.712
Do you want me to help you?

00:29:25.142 --> 00:29:26.514
You can help others this much,

00:29:27.103 --> 00:29:28.211
so you should be able
to help yourself too, right?

00:29:39.099 --> 00:29:40.303
Uncle Peng said to give you some stuff—

00:29:40.671 --> 00:29:46.197
apples, dark chocolate, ginkgo nuts, and fish.

00:29:46.878 --> 00:29:48.085
All the good stuff.

00:29:48.895 --> 00:29:49.616
Eat up.

00:29:49.616 --> 00:29:50.882
They'll be good for your brain.

00:29:51.103 --> 00:29:53.458
Maybe you'll remember who you are
and where you're from.

00:29:54.415 --> 00:29:55.167
Thanks,

00:29:56.216 --> 00:29:57.748
but I'm not hungry yet.

00:29:58.852 --> 00:29:59.609
Not hungry?

00:30:00.805 --> 00:30:01.508
Fine, I'll eat it myself.

00:30:02.704 --> 00:30:04.095
Seriously, all of this is top-notch.

00:30:08.677 --> 00:30:09.834
Didn't you bring it for me?

00:30:11.569 --> 00:30:12.582
Well, you're not eating it.

00:30:16.489 --> 00:30:19.004
Do you remember
puking all over me on the boat?

00:30:22.077 --> 00:30:24.251
Did you see who I came with?

00:30:25.907 --> 00:30:27.111
How would I know?

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.061
I didn't notice.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.122
All I saw was you puking your guts out.

00:30:30.508 --> 00:30:31.332
I felt sorry for you,

00:30:32.712 --> 00:30:34.946
and then you ended up washed ashore
like Prince Eric.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.403
Prince Eric?!

00:30:38.574 --> 00:30:39.151
Who's that?

00:30:41.065 --> 00:30:42.498
Don't tell me you don't know him.

00:30:42.756 --> 00:30:45.087
Prince Eric from The Little Mermaid.

00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:46.733
The mermaid movie.

00:30:47.248 --> 00:30:48.499
Have you ever watched cartoons?

00:30:48.922 --> 00:30:50.181
Watch some, okay?

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.568
Cartoons spark imagination, you know.

00:30:54.255 --> 00:30:56.287
If it weren't for a hero shark like me
saving you,

00:30:56.569 --> 00:30:59.069
you'd already be a corpse under the sea.

00:31:05.634 --> 00:31:06.587
Want a ginkgo nut?

00:31:12.126 --> 00:31:13.177
It's good for your brain.

00:31:27.496 --> 00:31:30.242
Hurry up and eat
so you can finally remember who you are.

00:31:30.684 --> 00:31:31.931
Then we won't have to see each other again.

00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:33.045
I've had enough trouble already.

00:31:47.929 --> 00:31:49.650
Don't forget to take your medicine.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:50.245
Got it.

00:31:58.912 --> 00:32:00.282
Lunch break already, Doc?

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:18.208
Is it tasty?

00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:21.274
Super tasty!

00:32:25.046 --> 00:32:25.657
Feed me.

00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:33.705
Say ahh.

00:32:40.339 --> 00:32:41.249
Chief!

00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:42.737
This is a hospital.

00:32:43.466 --> 00:32:44.548
How can you do this?

00:32:46.425 --> 00:32:47.797
I locked the door.

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:51.938
We can even do more than feeding.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:58.899
No.

00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:02.051
I just miss you.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.328
Since Lava came to live at my place,

00:33:04.328 --> 00:33:05.654
we've hardly met.

00:33:06.569 --> 00:33:08.198
Even without him,

00:33:09.284 --> 00:33:10.959
you wouldn't act like this, Chief.

00:33:11.198 --> 00:33:12.710
You're always wary.

00:33:16.569 --> 00:33:18.083
Well, I'm not ready yet.

00:33:18.727 --> 00:33:20.267
The locals will gossip,

00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:23.215
and then there's your dad.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.331
He's the school principal.

00:33:25.552 --> 00:33:26.678
I'll get shot

00:33:28.721 --> 00:33:30.965
for messing with his only son,

00:33:32.584 --> 00:33:33.755
who's both handsome

00:33:36.055 --> 00:33:37.189
and smart.

00:33:48.218 --> 00:33:49.191
Doctor!

00:33:52.356 --> 00:33:53.224
What's wrong, Kratae?

00:33:53.224 --> 00:33:55.049
There's a patient escaping from the hospital.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.183
Which patient?

00:34:14.763 --> 00:34:15.764
Right there, Chief!

00:34:15.764 --> 00:34:17.462
Stop! Stop!

00:34:20.646 --> 00:34:21.269
Hey.

00:34:23.772 --> 00:34:24.749
Where are you going?

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.608
I'm going home.

00:34:28.437 --> 00:34:29.611
Do you remember where your house is?

00:34:30.089 --> 00:34:30.800
What's your name?

00:34:31.297 --> 00:34:32.349
If you do, I'll take you there.

00:34:36.029 --> 00:34:36.790
Hey!

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:37.750
Get in the car.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:38.250
Doc, let's go.

00:34:41.765 --> 00:34:43.246
If we leave him at the hospital,

00:34:43.467 --> 00:34:44.831
he'll probably try to run away again.

00:34:45.328 --> 00:34:47.898
Physically, he's fine now.

00:34:48.321 --> 00:34:50.301
But mentally and memory-wise…

00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:50.872
it's rough.

00:34:51.569 --> 00:34:53.777
It's been a week,
and no one has come looking for him.

00:34:54.771 --> 00:34:55.571
Poor guy.

00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:01.446
But maybe going out into the world will help.

00:35:01.832 --> 00:35:03.794
He needs to go out, meet people,

00:35:05.045 --> 00:35:08.447
or experience something
that helps him remember.

00:35:09.514 --> 00:35:10.851
But someone needs to keep an eye on him.

00:35:19.627 --> 00:35:20.506
Alright, let's do it this way.

00:35:22.696 --> 00:35:23.785
You know what?

00:35:23.877 --> 00:35:26.532
Uncle Peng has been putting me to work
like a servant here.

00:35:26.863 --> 00:35:28.382
I just want to go back to Bangkok.

00:35:28.934 --> 00:35:30.539
I'm so bored of this place.

00:35:30.723 --> 00:35:33.988
(Then come. You can stay at my place.)

00:35:34.172 --> 00:35:35.988
Alright, you said it yourself.

00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:36.758
I'm going.

00:35:36.832 --> 00:35:40.219
(Come. I can take care of you, dude.)

00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:42.675
Alright. See you then.

00:36:02.999 --> 00:36:03.809
How did you even get here?

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:06.535
You want me to take care of him?

00:36:07.124 --> 00:36:07.754
Yeah.

00:36:08.232 --> 00:36:12.874
Let him stay until the police find his family
or until he remembers.

00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:14.989
Just keep him company.

00:36:18.228 --> 00:36:19.167
He's not family,

00:36:19.682 --> 00:36:20.648
not even a friend.

00:36:21.402 --> 00:36:22.986
And if no one comes for him,

00:36:23.317 --> 00:36:24.687
do we have to look after him forever?

00:36:24.853 --> 00:36:26.013
Don't you pity him?

00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:28.359
He has no memory, no place to go.

00:36:28.727 --> 00:36:30.404
Try having some heart for others, will you?

00:36:30.643 --> 00:36:31.958
Don't just think about yourself.

00:36:32.547 --> 00:36:33.970
If you're going to help, do it all the way.

00:36:36.878 --> 00:36:38.634
If you want me to take care of him,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.674
then pay me extra.

00:36:41.392 --> 00:36:42.133
It's an extra job.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.808
You're just unbelievable.

00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:50.276
Alright, alright. I'll give you more.

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:52.373
Take good care of him, okay?

00:36:52.612 --> 00:36:53.592
Dr. Wut said so.

00:36:55.874 --> 00:36:57.429
First, show him the bedroom and bathroom.

00:36:57.742 --> 00:36:58.933
Then we'll figure out the rest.

00:37:05.816 --> 00:37:06.478
Eh?

00:37:07.674 --> 00:37:09.244
Stop sitting there like a lost dog.

00:37:09.244 --> 00:37:09.927
Follow me.

00:37:27.596 --> 00:37:29.588
The bedroom's separate from the resort.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.110
Uncle Peng stays at the resort.

00:37:33.049 --> 00:37:34.658
This is my room.

00:37:46.902 --> 00:37:48.771
Eh? Why are you standing there dumb?

00:37:48.881 --> 00:37:49.632
Come in.

00:37:59.342 --> 00:38:00.650
It's this tiny.

00:38:00.797 --> 00:38:01.651
Two people here?

00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:02.430
It's a total nightmare.

00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:07.106
And you didn't bring anything at all?

00:38:10.345 --> 00:38:10.983
I don't have anything.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.987
I just have the clothes I'm wearing.

00:38:17.993 --> 00:38:19.168
Fine. Wear mine for now.

00:38:19.941 --> 00:38:20.851
I'll take you shopping later.

00:38:21.569 --> 00:38:23.414
I'll set up a mattress for you.

00:38:23.561 --> 00:38:24.546
You sleep on the floor.

00:38:24.656 --> 00:38:25.608
I'll take the bed.

00:38:27.098 --> 00:38:28.262
Can't I sleep in the bed?

00:38:28.476 --> 00:38:29.251
No.

00:38:29.821 --> 00:38:31.298
It's too cramped for two.

00:38:31.832 --> 00:38:33.196
I'll divide the area.

00:38:33.196 --> 00:38:35.203
You stay on the left,
and I stay on the right.

00:38:36.215 --> 00:38:37.383
No crossing zones, okay?

00:38:37.383 --> 00:38:38.854
No leaving stuff lying around.

00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:46.651
Shower, change, and get ready for dinner.

00:38:50.147 --> 00:38:51.205
But I go first.

00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:56.829
Here, you follow my orders.

00:38:57.455 --> 00:38:58.626
Don't try to resist, got it?

00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:27.355
You don't even know
how to wear fisherman pants?

00:39:29.682 --> 00:39:30.775
I've never worn them before.

00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:32.065
Just tie it tight.

00:39:32.065 --> 00:39:33.000
It won't fall off.

00:39:34.083 --> 00:39:35.024
How do I tie it?

00:39:35.468 --> 00:39:36.372
It's slipping already.

00:39:36.372 --> 00:39:37.076
Damn.

00:39:39.474 --> 00:39:40.557
Hold my towel for me.

00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:42.307
What?

00:39:43.035 --> 00:39:44.343
Hold my towel for me.

00:39:45.693 --> 00:39:47.276
Or you want to see my junk?

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:52.128
No,

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.470
I don't want to see that.

00:39:58.378 --> 00:39:59.045
Just hold it.

00:40:22.092 --> 00:40:22.759
Fine. That's it.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.080
What's so hard about that?

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.809
Hey, let go already.

00:40:34.214 --> 00:40:34.884
Thanks.

00:40:36.885 --> 00:40:37.869
What can you even do?

00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:43.897
Alright, so what should I call you?

00:40:43.897 --> 00:40:44.782
You don't even have a name.

00:40:49.187 --> 00:40:50.502
I don't know either.

00:40:51.253 --> 00:40:52.432
What do you want to call me?

00:40:54.954 --> 00:40:55.694
I got it.

00:40:56.937 --> 00:40:59.939
I'll call you “Weakling.”

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.778
No way.

00:41:02.275 --> 00:41:03.729
I'm not weak.

00:41:05.292 --> 00:41:07.910
Then how about Tidal Smash?

00:41:08.923 --> 00:41:10.685
Thunder Sky?

00:41:11.982 --> 00:41:13.335
Little Fisherman Pants?

00:41:14.259 --> 00:41:14.974
Nope.

00:41:15.631 --> 00:41:16.938
None of those fit me.

00:41:18.537 --> 00:41:20.246
Why don't you let Dr. Phish name you?

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.835
Dr. Phish?

00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:22.688
Uh-huh.

00:41:24.198 --> 00:41:25.102
Who's that?

00:41:25.386 --> 00:41:27.393
Ugh, what do you know?

00:41:28.689 --> 00:41:31.826
Are you really going to let a vet name me?

00:41:32.536 --> 00:41:33.234
No way.

00:41:33.802 --> 00:41:35.328
Ugh, I can't with this.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.289
You can't make sense
of anything I said.

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:49.012
Alright, I got it.

00:41:49.936 --> 00:41:51.236
I'll name you…

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:53.555
What?

00:41:56.202 --> 00:41:56.817
Wave.

00:41:58.647 --> 00:41:59.268
Wave?

00:42:00.778 --> 00:42:01.884
Why Wave?

00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:03.715
Because the wave brought you to me.

00:42:08.191 --> 00:42:08.887
See?

00:42:09.331 --> 00:42:10.938
The story behind the name
means something.

00:42:10.938 --> 00:42:12.222
I'm a genius!

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:17.980
Fine.

00:42:19.348 --> 00:42:22.072
Wave is a nice name.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.866
And don't be so formal
or polite with me.

00:42:26.955 --> 00:42:28.333
Just talk to me like friends. It's fine.

00:42:28.333 --> 00:42:29.089
I don't mind.

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:31.981
But I prefer to talk this way.

00:42:32.887 --> 00:42:34.318
I'm not a rude guy.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.382
Look at you, Mr. High-Class.

00:42:37.382 --> 00:42:37.882
You jerk.

00:42:48.189 --> 00:42:48.730
Wave.

00:42:50.897 --> 00:42:51.635
My name's Wave.

00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:02.916
Do you even know how old you are?

00:43:09.737 --> 00:43:11.666
I'd say he's about the same as us.

00:43:12.091 --> 00:43:12.752
Look at his face.

00:43:16.287 --> 00:43:17.469
Aha, I just got an idea.

00:43:21.554 --> 00:43:22.241
Smile!

00:43:24.481 --> 00:43:25.762
Why are you taking my picture?

00:43:25.904 --> 00:43:27.273
I'm posting online, of course.

00:43:27.628 --> 00:43:28.616
So someone might recognize you.

00:43:30.286 --> 00:43:33.707
But wow, you look fine and rich.

00:43:33.778 --> 00:43:35.105
You also talk politely.

00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:39.371
Or…

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:47.085
maybe he's a billionaire heir
kidnapped for ransom?!

00:43:52.521 --> 00:44:00.049
Or a prince from some faraway land,

00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:04.498
far far away…

00:44:04.836 --> 00:44:08.159
loooong far away?

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.258
Hmm, okay, enough.

00:44:10.791 --> 00:44:12.094
I won't go running off into eight notes.

00:44:12.804 --> 00:44:14.391
What the hell are you rambling about, Tum?

00:44:14.529 --> 00:44:15.246
Asshole.

00:44:15.832 --> 00:44:17.854
Come on, don't think I'm joking around.

00:44:17.854 --> 00:44:20.049
If he really is a prince, it's a jackpot.

00:44:20.049 --> 00:44:21.489
Seriously, it's a total jackpot.

00:44:21.809 --> 00:44:23.090
Got it?

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.634
You should treat him well.

00:44:25.169 --> 00:44:26.650
At your service, Your Majesty.

00:44:27.254 --> 00:44:28.866
But you? You're my servant.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:30.822
Now sit down and eat.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.133
Stop daydreaming.

00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:37.438
Geez, this isn't fun at all.

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:21.698
What the hell are you doing?

00:45:22.533 --> 00:45:23.416
Why are you up here?

00:45:23.416 --> 00:45:24.563
I can't sleep on the floor.

00:45:25.049 --> 00:45:26.056
The mat is too hard.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.399
I can't fall asleep.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.291
Where do you even come from,
Mr. Highborn?

00:45:30.966 --> 00:45:32.858
You don't have to
get all into what Tum said, alright?

00:45:33.586 --> 00:45:34.347
Just go sleep on the floor.

00:45:34.529 --> 00:45:35.345
I'm not going.

00:45:35.682 --> 00:45:36.913
I'm sleeping here.

00:45:37.108 --> 00:45:38.157
You can't.

00:45:38.548 --> 00:45:39.763
I take up a lot of space.

00:45:40.172 --> 00:45:40.998
I toss and turn.

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.646
If I keep flailing, my foot might hit your face.

00:45:44.854 --> 00:45:46.048
You toss and turn, right?

00:45:48.322 --> 00:45:49.555
Then go sleep on the floor.

00:45:50.763 --> 00:45:53.632
On the floor, you can sleep
any way you want.

00:45:54.485 --> 00:45:55.729
You can even do somersaults if you like.

00:45:56.013 --> 00:45:56.692
Are you messing with me?

00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:57.906
Go down.

00:45:58.403 --> 00:45:58.954
No!

00:45:59.824 --> 00:46:00.698
Down.

00:46:01.195 --> 00:46:01.855
No!

00:46:02.352 --> 00:46:03.380
Down.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:03.910
No way!

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:04.410
Down!

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.049
No!

00:46:05.049 --> 00:46:05.562
Go down!

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:06.080
No!

00:46:06.986 --> 00:46:07.678
Go down!

00:46:07.785 --> 00:46:08.373
No!

00:46:08.649 --> 00:46:09.866
You're not going down?

00:46:09.866 --> 00:46:11.827
You're not going down, huh?

00:46:14.209 --> 00:46:15.100
You're sure you're not?

00:46:15.186 --> 00:46:15.920
What are you doing?

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.644
You're really resisting, huh?

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.242
Those who resist deserve this.

00:46:34.115 --> 00:46:34.927
Ouch!

00:46:39.551 --> 00:46:41.470
Oww, my balls!

00:46:43.317 --> 00:46:44.029
Serves you right.

00:46:46.185 --> 00:46:47.102
Sleep in bed then.

00:46:47.599 --> 00:46:48.501
I'll take the floor.

00:46:49.442 --> 00:46:52.093
Uncle Peng asked you to take care of me.

00:46:52.395 --> 00:46:54.773
You're making a sacrifice. That's correct.

00:46:56.531 --> 00:46:58.571
Don't use your illness to threaten me.

00:46:59.051 --> 00:46:59.788
Pathetic.

00:47:00.943 --> 00:47:02.031
I'm not threatening.

00:47:02.031 --> 00:47:03.401
I'm just comfortable like this.

00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:05.104
But I'm not comfortable or whatever with you.

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:15.049
I'll hurry you up to remember who you are.

00:47:17.009 --> 00:47:18.653
Then I'll finally be free of burden.

00:47:28.331 --> 00:47:29.539
Man, this is such a drag.

00:47:32.452 --> 00:47:33.158
Damn it!

00:47:49.411 --> 00:47:51.098
DIRECTED BY
TICHAKORN PHUKHAOTONG

00:47:51.098 --> 00:47:53.318
Today I have to take you to do so much stuff.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.568
Do I even have to wash your underwear too?

00:47:55.568 --> 00:47:56.076
Yeah.

00:47:56.236 --> 00:47:58.419
I'm going to tell Uncle Peng you're smoking weed.

00:47:58.419 --> 00:47:59.299
You want it this way, huh?

00:47:59.441 --> 00:48:00.579
I can't keep up with you.

00:48:00.846 --> 00:48:02.088
I order you to stay.

00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:02.862
Who are you?

00:48:02.969 --> 00:48:03.793
My parents?

00:48:04.042 --> 00:48:05.016
Or my wife?

00:48:05.371 --> 00:48:05.871
Hey!

00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:09.270
Tomorrow, can you take me back to the beach where we met?

00:48:09.483 --> 00:48:10.830
Maybe I can remember something.

00:48:11.416 --> 00:48:11.916
Come!

00:48:13.728 --> 00:48:14.554
What are you doing?

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:16.250
I'll show you how I did it.

00:48:16.569 --> 00:48:19.823
I want to remember who I am.
