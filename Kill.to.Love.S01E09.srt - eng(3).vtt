WEBVTT

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.959
Tonight, on top of these city walls,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.999
there is no Duan Zi Ang...

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.200
and no Xiao Shu He!

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.600
The prince of South Hui and the crown prince of Ji North...

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920
should never...

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.160
have met.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.480
You should go.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.320
Soldiers of South Hui, listen up!

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.720
Capture the assassin from Ji North...

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.400
and avenge my brother!

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.880
Did you capture the assassin from Ji North?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960
Your Highness,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.920
Duan Zi Ang is very skilled.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.560
The soldiers have tried their best to chase him.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.840
Seeing the dagger is the same as seeing me.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.080
Father and Shu Qian are no longer here.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.200
Someone has to take on the responsibility...

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.040
of governing the South Hui Kingdom.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.200
Although I was born in the palace,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.600
I always dreamt of paradise.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.679
I thought that between poetry and wine,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.240
was where I belonged in life.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
But it turns out...

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.680
that it was just a dream that I fooled myself with.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.320
Now that I've woken up,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.800
I know that behind me is my country...

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.960
and in front of me...

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.120
is my duty.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.480
I have nowhere to run.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.079
I had just heard that you, the profligate son,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.160
wanted to share my burdens.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520
I've been obsessed with poetry for too long.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.080
The soul and the spirit ought to speak to one another.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.560
Do not be born into the imperial family.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.000
If I take over the world one day,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.480
I'll be suffocated.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.639
In the 25th year of the Great Xiao,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.359
the emperor passed away.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.359
Crown Prince Shu Qian was killed by a Ji North assassin.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.880
He was 24 years old.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.999
Sixth Prince Shu He heard the news...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.919
and led the Imperial Guards to the rescue.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.759
But the crown prince had already passed away.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.119
The ministers were horrified.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.279
Prime Minister Gu Yuan Shan and others...

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.359
were warned by the late emperor...

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.999
that the state cannot be without a ruler for a day...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.520
and to appoint Shu He to the throne.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.080
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.719
Within the month,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.919
Xiao Shu He succeeded the throne in Nanling...

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.919
and ushered in the Jinghe era.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.480
He issued a nationwide amnesty.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.520
(South Hui Kingdom)

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.680
(Ji North Kingdom)

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.000
Duan Zi Ang, hear the decree.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.479
The crown prince of South Hui...

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.639
was power-hungry,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.920
tyrannical, and merciless.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.999
Duan Zi Ang has made great contributions...

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.559
by assassinating the crown prince of South Hui,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.039
ridding His Majesty's worries,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.439
and securing peace for the Ji North Kingdom.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.919
Therefore, he is appointed Chief Commander...

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.960
to serve His Majesty in unifying the Central Plain.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.720
That is all.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.360
All these years,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.200
you have suffered.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.000
Your mission target is no longer the South Kingdom's crown prince.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.920
It's Xiao Shu He.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.720
You can either kill him...

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.800
or drink this poisoned wine.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.480
The old emperor is ruthless.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.039
He didn't leave a single portrait behind.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.160
He's extremely arrogant.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.839
I'm deeply moved by your generosity, Father.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840
I can't repay you.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.120
I can only pledge my loyalty to our kingdom.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.239
I'll slaughter all our enemies...

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.720
I'll protect my kingdom forever.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.960
to repay Your Majesty's kindness.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.760
His Majesty forbade you from going to the southern border.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.400
He has his reasons.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.480
Have something to eat.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Is something bothering you?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.319
It's nothing.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.520
Yesterday, His Majesty issued an order.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.360
You look worried and uneasy.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.760
Do you care about South Hui?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.600
Or do you miss him?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440
Zi Ang,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.320
trust is a fragile thing.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.280
A reunion after a long separation?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.120
Revenge for your father?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.640
What is the truth?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.040
Back then, I promised him...

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.960
that I wouldn't lie to him again.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.440
But before I could say anything,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.920
we had become enemies for life.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280
It was because of me...

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.040
that you sneaked into Sixth Prince's Manor...

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.960
and did something you would regret for life.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.400
I don't regret it.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.600
I don't want to lose him.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.240
And I definitely don't want to lose you.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.840
But what stands between the two of you now...

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.440
is a feud between the North and the South.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360
Therefore,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.880
as long as I can rule the world,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.560
I can have him.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.439
In the spring of the second year of the Jinghe era,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.839
Xiao Shu He proclaimed...

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.919
the closure of all paths to the south...

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.039
and the severance of all diplomatic relations.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.319
Violators would be accused of treason...

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.399
and moved to guard the border.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.279
The North Kingdom also closed its doors in response.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.559
The friendship between the two kingdoms...

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.880
was terminated.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.399
Xiao Shu He is now the emperor of the South Kingdom.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.480
There's no chance of contacting him.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.000
Big Brother, don't miss your old friend...

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.480
and hurt your health.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.399
With the statuses you both have now,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.720
there is no chance of meeting again.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.440
It's time to let him go.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.720
I knew that the moment Xiao Shu Qian died!

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.520
Everything I'm doing now is to see him again.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.760
How?

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.199
In the third winter of the Jinghe era,

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.039
Chief Commander Duan Zi Ang of Ji North...

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.600
led his troops back to the imperial court.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.760
Your Majesty,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.839
Duan Zi Ang ascended to the throne of Ji North.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.320
I'm afraid it won't be good for South Hui.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.560
Duan Zi Ang?

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.920
How did he gain power?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I don't know.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.679
The old emperor of Ji North passed away.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.120
Duan Zi Ang mustered an army and is on a military conquest.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.200
It seems he wants to rule the world.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.120
You and I...

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.920
have become enemies after all.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.639
In the fourth year of the Jinghe era,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.399
the new emperor of Ji North, Duan Zi Ang, ascended the throne...

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.559
and sent troops to the south.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.320
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760
Report!

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.240
The Ji North army has dispatched troops to the border.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.320
Duan Zi Ang's envoys seek an audience.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.840
I won't see them.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.079
Drag them out.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.440
Don't ever mention him again.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.280
Shu He,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.719
five years of winter and summer have passed.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.680
How is your health, Your Majesty?

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.560
The scenery in the South Kingdom must not have changed.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.360
The memory of the short time we spent together in the manor...

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.240
is like the reflection of the moon on water.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.480
Though I know I can't pursue it,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.040
it's engraved in my heart.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280
For five years,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.720
I climbed a bloody path to the throne.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.959
It was not because I am hungry for power.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.280
It was because I wanted to gain a foothold.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.040
It is my hope that in this position,

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280
I can see you again.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280
Men!

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.520
Deliver this letter to the emperor of South Hui.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200
Make haste.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.559
Today,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.920
since I'm the emperor of the North,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.000
I know what happened in the past can't be undone.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.200
I hope Your Majesty will consider our past friendship...

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.520
and allow trade between our two kingdoms.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.240
This is not just for diplomatic relations.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.360
It's also my way of seeking a way back into your heart.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.720
Trust is a fragile thing.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.440
If you really do something harmful to South Hui,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.880
I won't forgive you.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.160
I don't dare to ask for your forgiveness.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.160
I only hope...

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.000
that we can communicate with each other.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.760
Your Majesty, there is no reply.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.960
This is the only thing...

00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:19.000
that the emperor of the South Kingdom sent back.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.040
Seeing the dagger is like seeing me.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.760
The dagger is here.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.520
Think of me whenever you're in danger.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200
Why?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.080
Why?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.880
Why?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.720
But what stands between the two of you now...

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.440
is a feud between the North and the South.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.480
Therefore,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.920
as long as I can rule the world,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.600
I can have him.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.040
Very well.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.200
Shu He,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.280
since our friendship...

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.200
is like this dagger to you...

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.680
Let's not meet again...

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.199
in this life.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.840
It has become a piece of scrap metal.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.000
Then,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.160
I shall use these million iron hooves...

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.880
to pave the way in the South Kingdom.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.880
A bloody path that leads straight to your throne room.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.640
I'm going to break down your palace doors myself...

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.200
and stand before your throne.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.480
I'm going to make sure you have nowhere to hide.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.000
You can't escape.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.880
Attack!

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.160
All armies, listen up!

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.560
Destroy the South Hui Kingdom!

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.880
Those who burn and pillage shall be executed.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.799
Anyone who captures Xiao Shu He alive...

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.039
will be rewarded with 10,000 taels of gold!

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.640
Anyone who harms him will have their family executed!

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.919
We don't retreat from today's battle!

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.200
While it's easy to take over a kingdom,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.400
people's hearts are hard to capture.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.439
When your two armies clash,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.080
how will you know if he loves you or hates you?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.520
Whether he loves me or hates me is a matter for later.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.160
Right now,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.240
I just want to see him.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.559
In the spring of the fifth year of the Jinghe era,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.439
the Northern army broke through Tianmen Pass...

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.039
and marched straight in.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.759
They breached the Southern capital.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.799
The South's Imperial Guards were absent from the battlefield.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.360
The capital fell at once.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.599
(South Hui Main Hall, South Hui Kingdom)

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.879
(The 17th day of the 12th month, the day that South Hui fell)

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880
Father,

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.520
I am ashamed to face my ancestors.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.720
It is my incompetence.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.920
In the afterlife,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.440
how can I face the ancestors of the Xiao family?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.640
Duan Zi Ang,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.240
I couldn't protect the kingdom.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.680
It's my fault.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.080
But I won't be your prisoner!

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.480
It's you, isn't it?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.120
You killed my brother.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.280
You destroyed my kingdom.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080
And now,

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.280
will you trample on my dignity too?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.279
The Northern army...

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.599
besieged the Southern capital.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.639
Shu He knew the tide had turned.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.799
He drew his sword to take his own life.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.519
Zi Ang rushed forward to capture him...

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.079
and brought him back to Ji North.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.600
The South Hui Kingdom was destroyed.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.560
Don't move.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.120
I'm afraid the wound will reopen.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.000
Did you shoot that arrow just now?

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040
That's right.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.240
You annihilated South Hui.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.799
Why did you save me?

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.920
I only annihilated South Hui to save you.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.680
Trust me.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.880
The one who was shouting outside the Imperial Garden...

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.120
must have been your brother.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.520
Do you still remember...

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.880
how you two were able to meet again?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.560
I still remember...

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.640
your kindness.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.680
You do?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.240
You blindfolded me.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.880
You must feel guilty...

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.280
and don't dare to face me.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.000
I covered your eyes...

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.880
because I couldn't bear to see you cry.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.479
In the fifth winter of the Jinghe era,

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.799
Zi Ang captured the former ruler of South Hui, Shu He,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.999
brought him back to the Northern capital,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.960
and gave him a new residence.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.600
All these years, you've been busy with political affairs.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200
You haven't returned to Sixth Prince's Manor, have you?

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.960
Duan Zi Ang.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.720
How much effort did you put in...

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.040
to cut out my old residence from my homeland...

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.520
and plant it in the land of your North Kingdom?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.040
I know that the throne...

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.960
was like a heavy shackle to you.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.000
Indeed, it's not as comfortable...

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.880
as the land in this manor.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.560
Indeed, I haven't been back to my old residence for a long time.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.520
But I remember every blade of grass...

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.040
and every tree in my manor.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.479
I also remember the wind blowing, the leaves falling,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.280
and the sandalwood incense wafting outside the window.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.520
Ever since you came here,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.080
the sounds of weapons clashing appeared in my manor.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.400
Although this place is very similar to my manor,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.560
there is nobody around.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.680
What exactly is this place?

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.960
If you stay here for a while,

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.720
people will naturally come.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.600
I know you're frail.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.320
You must be unfamiliar with Ji North.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.840
But if you can live in a residence that is similar to your old one,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840
perhaps...

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.840
you will be able to adapt better.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.920
You annihilated my kingdom.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.120
Now you've rebuilt my former manor in South Hui to humiliate me.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.919
Duan Zi Ang,

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.719
I should have killed you myself that night at the city gate!

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.720
I've put in so much effort to remake Sixth Prince's Manor!

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.640
How could you treat me like this?

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.360
Take him away!

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.200
Lock him up in this manor.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.600
Let him know that he wasted my good intentions.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.360
Go to the prisoner-of-war camp.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.600
Ask the palace maids of South Hui...

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.920
where the sandalwood incense used in Sixth Prince's Manor...

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.480
came from.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.400
Walk faster. We're falling behind.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.479
I don't even get to relieve myself.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.480
How can I walk faster?

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.560
Hey.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.880
Can I pee?

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120
Hold it in.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.559
If I hold it in much longer, I'll burst.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.920
Are you sure you want to be smelling urine the whole way?

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080
Go over there.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.120
Young Master Xiao,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.440
His Majesty prepared this Longjing tea for you.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.960
This incense was ordered by His Majesty at the last minute.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.879
If the preparation is lacking,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.240
please forgive me.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.960
Although your tea preparation is that of South Hui,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.640
your accent is from the north.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.840
Young Master Xiao,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.520
three years ago, His Majesty held a tea party...

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.080
and selected palace maids...

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.560
to learn the South Hui Kingdom's tea ceremony.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.120
I was one of the ones chosen to learn it.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.640
Young Master Xiao, you might not know this.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.280
His Majesty held this tea party...

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.440
because he loves the Longjing tea of South Hui.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.040
Secondly, as His Majesty always says,

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.800
after this residence is built,

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.920
an important guest from South Hui will come.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.920
This guest has specific tastes.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.799
His Majesty feared he wouldn't be used to the astringency...

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.920
of Ji North's flower tea.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.239
So he ordered the palace maids to learn South Hui's tea ceremony...

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.240
to prepare for it.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.040
We've all wondered who this important guest might be.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.240
It must be you, Young Master Xiao.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.760
What you said implies that...

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.439
he had been planning to destroy South Hui...

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.040
for three years!

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.440
What is the meaning of this?

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800
His Majesty has ordered me...

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.240
to watch over you, Young Master Xiao.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.280
What if I insist on leaving Ji North?

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.600
Then blood will be shed...

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.600
by the South Hui soldiers in the prisoner-of-war camp.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.800
(Sixth Prince's Manor)

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.159
Your Majesty conquered the Central Plain yourself.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.560
It's a great achievement.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.799
Your influence stretches in all directions.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.919
It is a great merit.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.280
- It is a great merit. - It is a great merit.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.360
I...

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.200
toast all of you.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.280
We are loyal.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.840
But I have my doubts today.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.840
To capture Xiao Shu He alive,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.080
I've lost so many of my men.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.560
Yet, he's sitting comfortably in the newly built palace.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.360
Your Majesty, please provide an explanation.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760
General Liu,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.520
I've heard that you love your soldiers like your own sons.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.199
You should know...

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.559
that even after destroying the East and West Kingdoms,

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.400
there are still many disasters in our territory.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.919
If we want to win the hearts of the people of South Hui,

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.360
we must take the gentle approach.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.439
If we are shortsighted in our haste,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.480
we will spoil our grand plan!

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.400
Prime Minister Duan, do you know...

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.320
that Xiao Shu He said something disrespectful...

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.880
to His Majesty at Sixth Prince's Manor?

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.440
The leader of South Hui...

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.520
is in Ji North.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.360
How dare he be so arrogant...

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560
as to insult my liege?

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.719
General Liu!

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.720
Huai Yi.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.280
What General Liu said...

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.720
is not unreasonable.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.320
I wanted to be kind to the former sovereign...

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.040
and reassure the people.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.800
But I didn't know he would be so nitpicky and critical.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.480
Tonight,

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.840
I was supposed to celebrate with all of you.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.440
How could I have known that this defeated emperor...

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.480
would trouble me so?

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.800
If Your Majesty is still concerned about this,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.560
why don't we put an end to it today?

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.240
We don't want your health to be harmed.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.640
I've already sent someone to fetch Xiao Shu He and wait here.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.280
Should I call him in?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.960
Bring him in.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280
Kneel.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.480
Today, Ji North Kingdom has achieved unification.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.960
I should be celebrating with my ministers.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.400
But you ruined the mood.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.480
I called you here...

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.200
to hear your explanation.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.680
What do I have to explain to you?

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.400
Don't speak to His Majesty that way.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.599
How dare he wear...

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.120
the South Hui's imperial robe in our palace?

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.600
He's asking for death.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.760
Remove the robe.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920
Remove it!

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.840
Thank His Majesty for his kindness in sparing your life.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.160
Kindness in sparing my life?

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.600
As the ruler of the South Hui Kingdom,

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600
today,

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.560
I only wish to die!

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.680
Dismissed!

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.680
You'll die when I tell you to.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.760
You'll live when I tell you to.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.080
Even if the King of Hell comes, he won't dare to take your life!

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.600
Everyone,

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.480
leave us.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.200
I have some private matters to discuss with Xiao Shu He.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.440
- Your Majesty. - Leave us!

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.800
When my army attacked the capital of South Hui,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.999
I gave a death order...

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.799
that no one from South Hui was to be killed.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.879
The battle lasted for weeks. How many soldiers listened to you?

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.040
Do you really not know?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.880
There was looting and burning.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.720
There was no mercy at all!

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.919
Let me tell you.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.199
When we breached the city gate,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.840
I thought there would be a bloodbath.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.319
In the end,

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.840
the people of the South Hui Kingdom welcomed us into the city.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.320
You're really funny,

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080
Duan Zi Ang.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.800
You really haven't changed.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.040
You're still a smooth talker.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.560
In their eyes,

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.640
Ji North came to save them.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.279
To save them from you,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.680
their incompetent emperor!

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.720
I should have listened to my ministers back then...

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.439
to attack the North Kingdom while your forces were weak...

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.040
and avenge my brother!

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.640
I really don't get it.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.799
You love the one who hates you,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.520
and you hate the one who loves you!

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.200
Aren't you both?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Guards!

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.840
Since he's not used to living in the palace,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.720
lock him up in the dungeon!

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.480
For the sake of the throne,

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.840
what kind of monster will you become before you stop?

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.160
But what stands between the two of you now...

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.960
is a feud between the North and the South.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.600
(Three years ago, when Duan Zi Ang returned to the capital)

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.200
Therefore,

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.240
as long as I can rule the world,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.880
I can have him.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.160
Do you know what you're saying?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.560
If I fail,

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.960
I don't want to drag you down with me.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.760
You unfilial son!

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.920
I didn't care that you're an illegitimate child.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.120
Is this how you repay me?

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.240
Take off your imperial robe.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.080
I'll spare your life.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.640
This is the best way to repay you.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.320
If you really want to be the emperor,

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.399
the first thing you need to learn...

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.039
is to kill without hesitation!

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.040
Just like what you did to my mother?

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.120
I won't lose a kingdom...

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.879
because of a romance!

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.280
I don't care about the kingdom!

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.360
I just want one person!

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.799
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.840
- Long live the emperor! - Long live the emperor!

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.080
The cause of His Majesty's illness...

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.799
is the poison he took from the Red Shadow Guards.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.120
His body has long been weakened.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.880
Is there a cure for this illness?

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.440
If you can treat him,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840
you will be rewarded handsomely.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.840
My medical skills are lacking.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.520
I am unable to cure him.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.240
However,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.600
I know of a strange physician...

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.560
who might be able to cure His Majesty.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.240
Who is this person? Where does he live now?

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.520
South Hui was destroyed.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.400
One of the captives in the palace...

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.680
was a wanderer in the martial arts world.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.040
He learned from masters of medicine all over the world.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.760
He is well-versed in medicine.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.240
He's good at treating complicated diseases.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.520
If that's the case, why didn't you bring him?

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.720
I took it upon myself...

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.960
to ask him to wait outside.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.120
Summon him in.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.920
As the emperor,

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.200
you must have done a lot of bad things.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.120
Is it the poison of your own heart?

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.560
Or is it karma?

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.680
Young man,

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.520
what crime have you committed...

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.320
to end up like this?

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.680
You look...

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.640
like a nobleman.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.040
No wonder someone gave you a blanket.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.680
If you are cold,

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.240
you can take it.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.760
You're covered in silk.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.840
You speak with a southern accent.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.800
Are you...

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.080
the sixth prince of South Hui?

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.040
I am the ruler of South Hui,

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.720
Xiao Shu He.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.960
Nonsense!

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.520
I was ordered by the late emperor...

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.000
to renovate the imperial residence.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.040
I've worked hard for decades.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.880
Then I ended up at Sixth Prince's Manor!

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.960
Even in this dungeon,

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.840
I can't escape from the manor.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.800
Do you think I want to be here?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.960
If it wasn't for the Sixth Prince's Manor,

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.560
I would be able to see my grandson...

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.880
who has just turned one month old.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.480
What happened to the Sixth Prince's Manor?

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.640
Three years ago, I received an order from His Majesty...

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.240
to replicate Sixth Prince's Manor of South Hui.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.160
I was worried at the time.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.920
The Sixth Prince's Manor was an important place in South Hui.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.320
No one knew what it really looked like.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.480
He actually remembers...

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.960
every detail about the manor.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.000
That's not all.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.000
He remembers everything that happened...

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.600
in every corner.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.080
I should have known then...

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.560
that this manor was special to him.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.440
I wouldn't dare to change it in the future.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.160
Why don't I believe you?

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.240
To this day, I still don't understand.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.120
His Majesty said it himself.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.640
There's a private cabinet in your room.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.840
His Majesty's paintings and a memorial tablet are in there.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.880
I know it's bad feng shui.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.400
I was afraid it would affect the nation's luck.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.240
So I sealed the cabinet's door without permission.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.880
To my surprise, His Majesty was furious when he found out.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.360
Then I was imprisoned here.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.240
It's strange though.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.280
Why did you add such a strange cabinet back then?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.560
All the clues you found were planted by me.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.040
Every single item...

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.320
was a part of my calculations.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.200
Absurd.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.840
He clearly knew...

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.200
that it was all fake.
