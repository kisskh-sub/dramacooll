00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.482
{\an8}Damn punk.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.400
{\an8}Take that, asshole.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.027
{\an8}"Stop bullying the weak"?

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.111
{\an8}Trample him.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.907
{\an8}You damn punk!
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:15.742
{\an8}Damn asshole!

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:17.786
{\an8}Hey, the cop is here.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.454
{\an8}- The cop!
- Damn punks…

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.014
Why didn't you fight back?

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:41.601
You know taekwondo, boxing, and judo.
Did you just learn all that for show?

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.728
I don't do it to learn how to hit people.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:46.314
But still, a man should be able
to throw a punch before he dies!

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:50.735
And what if they die?

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:57.117
Detective Choi.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.994
I promise I'm really fine now.

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.538
I'm living my life, so…

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.624
Enjoy.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.876
So eat this,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.379
and stop coming to see me from now on.

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.806
You know, Detective Choi
doesn't mix jjajangmyeon just for anyone.

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:23.935
Even if you snitch on something big,
there's only a chance I might.

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:28.439
Cha Su-yeol.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.359
You should become a cop.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.446
Let's see.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.740
Since five people have died…

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:48.543
you can save five people.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.754
You should become a police officer.

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.257
Even better if you save more.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:10.315
Why did he ask for this?

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.025
Can you make that brighter?

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:13.109
Brighter?

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.486
A SECOND MURDER CASE IN WOONGSAN

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.323
Zoom in here.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:23.953
What the?

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:26.873
- The image is flipped.
- Yeah.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.541
I guess it was a printing mistake.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.460
Hold on.

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.593
HSART

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.678
What the?

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.431
Then, the head was actually
on the left side,

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.391
and not the right.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.561
It seems like the newspaper print
was flipped.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.156
He did not reference
this newspaper clipping.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.993
{\an8}He must have seen
court or investigative records.

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:10.708
Hey.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:14.212
Can you search for court
and investigative records on Jeong I-shin?

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.297
You already are?

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:18.132
Okay.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.179
Let's get out of here.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.858
COURT

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.862
Pardon me. I'm with the police.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.739
Is Dr. Choi Mi-gyeong available?

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.742
She's currently overseas for a conference.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:45.868
Then,

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:49.789
by chance, could I get Dr. Choi's number?

00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:54.002
As per Jeong I-shin's request,
it was a closed trial.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.587
The judge, the prosecutor,
defense attorney, and the doctor

00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.258
who conducted the psych evaluation were
the only ones privy to the court records.

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:03.636
And the prosecution claims that
there have been no reported data leaks.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.097
The psychiatrist is supposed to return
to the country in a week.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.558
She says the only picture
she ever saw was in the paper.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.853
The judge died three years ago.

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.772
The defense attorney
isn't 100% sure after 23 years,

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.108
but he's never knowingly
shared court records.

00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:18.401
I asked if he still had them.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.028
He said he'd check and let me know.

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.864
Okay. Good job, everyone.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.412
He may be from Narcotics,
but he's pretty good.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.623
It's way too soon to be talking like that.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.423
Hello, Mr. Kim.
Were you able to locate the file?

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.221
I'm sure it used to be here.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.308
That's the only file missing.

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:55.438
Does anyone else have access
to this office besides you?

00:05:56.105 --> 00:06:00.026
There's the office cleaner,
and I sometimes have guests wait here

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.028
if I have a meeting that runs late.

00:06:02.653 --> 00:06:05.073
It wouldn't have been too difficult
if someone was determined.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.658
Is there anyone you suspect
from those who had access?

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.827
Just all acquaintances.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.496
It can be something minor.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.332
Has anyone unexpectedly tried
to cozy up to you?

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.293
Someone unexpected…

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:22.632
When I was building my house,
I had to deal with all this paperwork.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.842
Someone called about a missing document,

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.011
so I went to the district office.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:28.596
Then, what happened?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.973
It was their clerical mistake.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:34.602
The rep there was so apologetic.

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:36.354
We ended up chatting a bit.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.440
I think it's been 30 years already?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:44.278
The other lawyers at this office and I
sponsor a nearby orphanage.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:48.866
And it turned out
that rep grew up in that orphanage.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.494
Did you recognize him?

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.621
We only ever visited once a year.

00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:55.248
And with the large number of kids,

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:57.333
it's hard to remember every face.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:06:59.961
I guess he remembered mine.

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:03.172
He said he hesitated, unsure whether
to let on that he recognized me.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.674
Maybe he was here

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.092
about a year ago?

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:07.301
Just a moment.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.808
Here it is.

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:18.354
Here.

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:23.901
Seo Gu-wan,
Department of Safety Construction,

00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.736
Anam District Office.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.239
Did he also wait in this office?

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:30.158
Yes, he showed up unannounced.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.411
I asked him to wait here
until my meeting concluded.

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:36.747
Why did he come to mind now?

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.251
There was never a boy
by that name at the orphanage.

00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:43.337
I found out later
when I ran into its director.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.715
That did make me feel a bit uneasy,

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:49.302
but he didn't seem like a bad guy,
just a bit awkward.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.345
It's not like I was harmed in any way.

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:56.893
But are you saying
he might have taken the court records?

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.026
We'll do the afternoon walk in an hour.

00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:12.176
Go!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.847
After asking around, we found out

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.724
Seo Gu-wan is currently living alone.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.060
He goes to and from work
on his motorcycle.

00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:22.436
He should be home soon.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.730
Okay. Stay alert at the entrance,
and out of sight.

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:25.815
Yes, sir!

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.570
This is a nice car.

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:35.575
We confirmed he's an employee
at the Anam District Office.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:38.327
I just sent over what I found.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.666
CIVIL SERVICE CANDIDATE
REGISTRATION FORM:

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:44.750
SOCIAL WELFARE MAJOR

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.046
PARENTS: UNKNOWN

00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:56.679
It's not the orphanage
that the lawyer mentioned,

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.055
but he did grow up in one.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:01.350
There was a grain of truth
in all the lies.

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:05.646
They said this is usually
when he comes home.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:08.316
Hyuk, any updates?

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.525
None to report.

00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:12.570
When is this punk coming home?

00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:16.157
Everyone, listen carefully.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.825
Make sure he doesn't catch on,

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:21.078
and we don't make any movements
until we confirm he's inside his place.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.087
That was all unnecessary, wasn't it?

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:31.714
Not at all.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.549
That is the stage we're at.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.010
Checking off boxes
and feeling out each other's rhythm.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.183
I'm glad you see it like that.

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:44.977
I'm sure everyone was surprised.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.981
I just dropped out of the sky one day
and became your squad leader.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.692
They're a dependable bunch.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.195
Just remember we're on the same team.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:55.988
Okay.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.156
Sir, he's home!

00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:24.975
Seo Gu-wan! Hey!

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.436
Stop! You punk!

00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:30.731
- He got away.
- Damn it.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.149
Sung-gyu, he's headed
toward the main road.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.406
I see the motorcycle.
Blocking the road now.

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:42.910
Damn it.

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:44.829
Stop right there!

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:45.913
Get him!

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:47.665
- Damn punk.
- Stop!

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:49.708
Hey!

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:50.960
Stop, you punk!

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:52.586
Where are you, Hyuk?

00:11:59.718 --> 00:12:00.719
Seo Gu-wan!

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.391
Watch out!

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:07.059
Hyuk!

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:09.937
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.439
You almost killed him, Mister!

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:16.277
Hyuk, can you stand up? Are you okay?

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:25.536
Damn it.

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.894
He's collected all sorts of personal data.

00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:53.564
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD,
RESIDENT REGISTRATION RECORD

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:57.443
Seriously?

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.363
That's quite an impressive password
you got there.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.365
Found it. Jeong I-shin's court records.

00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:09.747
NAMBU DISTRICT COURT
RECORD OF TRIAL

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.047
He has the lawyer's records.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.299
And even the Anwon Prison guard's records.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.183
RESIDENT REGISTRATION RECORD

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:30.267
Captain.

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:38.192
CHA SU-YEOL
LEE JUNG-YEON

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:39.318
This bastard.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:41.195
Bae's, Hyuk's, and even mine.

00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:43.656
This bastard managed to dig up
all our personal information.

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:25.489
He couldn't change the lightbulb?

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.216
This crazy bastard.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.301
Detective Kim.

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.469
Captain.

00:14:55.853 --> 00:14:58.188
This son of a bitch is
devoted and diligent.

00:14:58.272 --> 00:14:59.607
It's like welcome to Mantis World.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.400
Excuse me.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.360
I think he's sick.

00:15:03.944 --> 00:15:06.196
I'll go and check out
the pharmacy that's listed.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.116
- Get yourself a bandage for that too.
- Okay.

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.745
I'm going to take this back to the office,

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:14.580
- and take it apart.
- Okay. See you.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.419
What's this? Why is it all wrapped up?

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.007
It looks like a safe.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:27.843
It's a 3D printer.

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.307
Captain.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.229
This is…

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.270
Kids, Daddy's home.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.982
I picked up some fried chicken.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:29.363
You're sleeping already?
You couldn't wait up for me?

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:31.407
So mean.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.033
You make me sad.

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:47.881
Then I'm going to finish it all by myself!

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.612
DEAR MR. SEO GU-WAN

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:14.324
From Jeong I-shin, Anwon Prison.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:19.663
Jeong I-shin sent him
letters from Anwon Prison?

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:21.832
What?

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:24.001
How did those two exchange letters?

00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:27.379
While the whole world thinks
Jeong I-shin is dead…

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.089
What's this bastard's deal?

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.217
What are you talking about?
I don't understand at all.

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:34.219
I'm back.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.020
That woman

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.314
is not helping us.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.648
She's using us.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.817
Seo Gu-wan was instructed to kill

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:49.902
by Jeong I-shin.

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:51.320
What?

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:07.628
It's late.
How rude of you to show up unannounced.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.093
Why did you do it?

00:18:15.302 --> 00:18:18.430
How could you egg on
blood-crazed Seo Gu-wan?

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.849
Were five killings not enough to sate you?

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:24.853
Answer me!

00:18:25.562 --> 00:18:26.939
You wrote those letters.

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:28.524
You told him he could kill people,

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:29.691
and be just like you!

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.486
You told him it was no big deal.

00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:35.614
Not once have I written
that nobody a letter.

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:40.285
Then, what are these?

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:47.084
Do you have proof I actually wrote these?

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.587
And you call yourself a police officer?

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.592
Are you saying you did not write them?

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:59.346
Turn the lights off on your way out.

00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:09.606
In prison,

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:13.819
your bedtime, mealtime, and wake-up time
are always the same.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.988
When the lights go off, you have to sleep.

00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:20.117
You have to follow that schedule
if you want to eat and see the sun.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.201
You know that, right?

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:25.664
So, anything that happens in the world
outside of our scheduled time,

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:27.249
you all take care of it.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:29.293
That's the order of things.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.045
Does it look like I'm here for a picnic?

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.215
This is a jail cell.

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:39.136
Come in the morning
if you want to have a discussion.

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:40.971
Aren't you a police officer?

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.882
Honey, you're not hungry?

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.727
The police have decided to reveal
the face of Seo Gu-wan,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.395
a prime suspect in the recent murders,

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.814
and announced they will carry out
a public investigation.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:36.235
Seo has a history of being treated
for schizophrenia and delusional disorder,

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:40.322
and is noted to have displayed
mental instability recently.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:45.035
Authorities warn that Seo may be
in possession of a firearm

00:20:45.118 --> 00:20:47.454
and poses an immediate threat
to public safety.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.665
The police noted his height to be…

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.250
{\an8}INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:20:52.292 --> 00:20:55.587
This is the handwritten confession
Jeong I-shin wrote

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.214
23 years ago.

00:20:57.297 --> 00:21:00.801
What you see on the right is a letter
Seo claims to have received from her.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.511
The handwriting seems--

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:03.971
It's not just the handwriting.

00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:06.640
There is not a single typo
in Jeong's confession.

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:09.142
Her sentences are concise.

00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:12.354
Comparatively,
the letter Seo Gu-wan received

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:15.607
contains a large number of typos.

00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:18.151
It was clearly written by someone else.

00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:21.780
Then, who wrote him those letters?

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.450
Please take a look at Seo's handwriting

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:28.662
in the blueprint for his homemade gun
and his notes.

00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:30.622
Seo Gu-wan wrote them himself.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:32.791
DEAR MR. SEO GU-WAN

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.378
Based on the evidence
we gathered at his home,

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:39.881
he worshipped Jeong I-shin
as if she were some sort of saint.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.925
There is a chance

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:46.138
Seo wanted to commit a murder
but lacked the courage to follow through,

00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:48.974
so he looked to Jeong for support

00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:50.475
or some sort of command.

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:54.563
I believe he inflicted
those delusions on himself.

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:58.775
It's possible, considering his history
of schizophrenia, a disorder

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:00.569
known for delusions and hallucinations.

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.321
I went to his pharmacy,

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:04.239
and I was able to obtain his prescription.

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.533
From there, I looked into his doctor.

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.493
He set up an appointment last month

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:09.870
but never showed up.

00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:14.666
A bit over a month ago
would be around the time

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.960
of the first murder at Nodu Stream.

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:19.629
His symptoms must have worsened
if he stopped taking his meds.

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:22.341
So, he's out of his mind,
making him even more unpredictable.

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:23.842
Any reports come in?

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:26.678
They're all baseless or pranks.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.014
UNLOCKED

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:31.558
Hey.

00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:33.852
I unlocked Seo Gu-wan's computer.

00:22:58.376 --> 00:23:01.505
Who is that Mister? Where's Daddy?

00:23:03.423 --> 00:23:04.633
Listen to me.

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.677
You must do whatever
that man tells you to do.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:09.888
You must.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.790
Who are these people?

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.630
He's definitely a nutcase.

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:44.840
What the?

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:45.924
Watch.

00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:49.094
This bastard…

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:51.680
There's a license plate.

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.015
We have a license plate.

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:56.518
Find out who it's registered under
and their address.

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:59.479
Have backup ready so we can move out
once the address is confirmed.

00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:00.814
And gear up.

00:24:00.897 --> 00:24:02.732
- Right, he could be armed.
- We got it.

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:03.817
Let's go.

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:07.028
Hello, this is Bae Sung-gyu
from Major Crimes Team One.

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:27.883
I repeat.

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:30.719
The police have decided to reveal
the face of Seo Gu-wan,

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.387
{\an8}a prime suspect in the recent murders,

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:36.016
{\an8}and announced they will carry out
a public investigation. Seo has a history…

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.023
I'm done.

00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:46.818
Mommy.

00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:48.486
You're okay. Don't be afraid.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.155
I did as you asked.

00:24:51.072 --> 00:24:52.824
Where's my husband?

00:24:52.908 --> 00:24:54.701
I hear the water running.

00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:01.958
Why do you have
the water running in the bathroom?

00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:03.668
Rip it.

00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:08.632
Rip that up.

00:25:14.304 --> 00:25:15.305
Mommy.

00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:16.514
You're okay.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:20.602
If we just do as that man says,
we'll all be okay.

00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:23.396
Right?

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.860
I mean, Daddy. Sorry.

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:29.945
He's Daddy.

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:33.448
If you just do as Daddy says,
we'll all be okay.

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:42.624
Rip it.

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:46.628
Do as Daddy says. Go on.

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:48.380
Where's our daddy?

00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:49.881
Where is he?

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:52.133
You're not our daddy, mister!

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.343
No. Stop that.

00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:54.928
I can rip it.

00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:57.097
He's just too little to understand.
Just let me do it.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.556
Seung-min, you…

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.849
Please just let me rip it.

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:01.434
Quiet.

00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:09.150
What's wrong?

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.446
There's someone else here, isn't there?

00:26:14.197 --> 00:26:15.240
It's just us.

00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:16.825
So-won!

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:19.369
Honey!

00:26:19.452 --> 00:26:21.037
Why are you lying to me?

00:26:21.121 --> 00:26:24.791
See? They're chatting away right now.

00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:27.294
You don't hear that?

00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:29.129
I don't hear anything.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.464
What chatter?

00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:33.133
I mean…

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:36.970
Then, are you saying
I'm crazy or something?

00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:39.514
Why can't you hear that?

00:26:39.597 --> 00:26:42.434
- You're a jerkface!
- That's no way to speak to your dad.

00:26:42.517 --> 00:26:45.020
This Mister is a jerkface.

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.271
Seung-min…

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.773
I need to teach you a lesson.

00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:52.152
- Seung-min!
- Mommy!

00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:53.361
Seung-min. Please, no.

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.821
Seung-min!

00:26:54.904 --> 00:26:57.157
- Seung-min! Please let him go!
- Mommy!

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.410
- This is a shared home for neighbors.
- Seung-min!

00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:04.873
- Please avoid causing noise disturbances.
- Mommy, save me!

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:07.625
- …Be mindful of neighbors when walking.
- Save me, Mommy!

00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:09.085
Please, I beg you.

00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:10.920
I'll do whatever you say.

00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:12.422
Please let him go.

00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:13.673
No! Daddy!

00:27:14.674 --> 00:27:16.760
Freeze. I'm with the police.

00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.553
Roger that.

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:20.138
I'm with the police.

00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:21.765
Let him down slowly.

00:27:21.848 --> 00:27:23.808
I told you someone else was here!

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:26.102
Shut up and let him down! Slowly.

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:28.271
He peed his pants.

00:27:28.355 --> 00:27:30.148
I just wanted to give him a bath.

00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:31.232
Let him down.

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:39.366
Seo Gu-wan.

00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:42.535
You're under arrest for the suspected
murder of Kim Hyeon-u and Kang Su-cheol…

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.204
You're Seung-min, right?

00:27:44.287 --> 00:27:46.748
Just hang in there.
I'll have you free in no time.

00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:47.957
…the right to remain silent.

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:50.668
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:53.171
And I'll be teaching you
a mighty lesson at the police agency.

00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:54.964
They're both safe.

00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:00.553
Hyuk, check the bedroom.

00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:01.721
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:04.641
- Mommy!
- Come here, my baby!

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:06.017
My babies!

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:07.685
Captain.

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:11.064
Mr. Kim Tae-seok isn't here.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.984
Hello there.

00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:16.069
Is that it?

00:28:16.152 --> 00:28:18.405
- Sir!
- At ease. Take care now.

00:28:26.079 --> 00:28:28.331
- Thank you for the food.
- Dig in.

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:30.375
NODU STREAM
VICTIM KIM HYEON-U

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:41.594
Kim Tae-seok, the missing husband,
and Seo Gu-wan are half-siblings.

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:43.763
Half-siblings? So, different fathers?

00:28:43.847 --> 00:28:46.099
Yes, that's right. Seo's birth mother

00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:49.394
gave up her parental rights
before he was even born.

00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:52.647
So, after he was born,
he was sent to the orphanage.

00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:56.109
And his birth mother
remarried a few months later.

00:28:56.693 --> 00:29:00.613
And a year afterward,
she gave birth to Kim Tae-seok.

00:29:01.197 --> 00:29:04.617
Ms. Kim Yeong-seon, his birth mother,
died of a chronic illness a year ago.

00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:08.955
It was his birth mother who abandoned him.
Why go after the half-brother?

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.501
Reverse Life.

00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.253
What is that?

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.590
We checked Seo's Internet history,

00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:21.760
and it showed he read this web novel,
Reverse Life, over a dozen times.

00:29:21.843 --> 00:29:24.721
It falls under what's commonly called
the RTR genre.

00:29:24.804 --> 00:29:26.055
"RTR"?

00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:28.850
Regression, Transmigration, Reincarnation.

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:31.186
Stories about lives that change overnight.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.312
Something like,

00:29:32.395 --> 00:29:36.065
a pauper wakes up to discover
he has become a prince overnight.

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:40.528
But Seo doesn't really fit the profile
for the Nodu Stream and Warehouse murders.

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:43.281
For now, just focus on Kim Tae-seok.

00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:45.450
Do whatever you have to do
to make Seo talk.

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:47.285
Kim Tae-seok can't end up on that wall.

00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:49.204
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:55.376
Mr. Kim Tae-seok. Her husband.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.669
Where is he right now?

00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:00.965
Is he still alive?

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:03.092
Mr. Seo,

00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:05.595
behaving like this
could end up hurting you later.

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.811
Mr. Seo.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:15.855
Mr. Seo.

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.113
Your mom abandoned you.

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:27.909
A mother, wife, and cute kids.

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.244
A happy family.

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:32.163
All of that could've been yours, no?

00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:33.289
It was meant to be mine.

00:30:33.373 --> 00:30:35.792
It's not "could've."
It was always meant to be mine.

00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:39.045
So did you just want to steal it from him?
Just like in Reverse Life?

00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:40.129
Steal? Come on.

00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:42.507
It was always mine.

00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:45.718
I was "abandoned"?

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.846
You must be talking about your son.

00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:50.431
"Waiving custody rights"
is just a nice way of putting it.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:53.184
Listen, if I were "abandoned"
at the orphanage,

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:56.688
then you "abandoned" your child
with that pathetic husband of yours.

00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:58.439
- How do you--
- You did, didn't you?

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.692
He was just an autistic pain
in the ass for you.

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:02.944
You asshole!

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:04.404
- Were you ashamed of him?
- Go.

00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:07.907
Of course, you wanted to abandon him.
It would've been even better if he died.

00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:09.534
Shut the hell up!

00:31:09.617 --> 00:31:11.995
- Detective Kim!
- Let go of me!

00:31:13.496 --> 00:31:15.081
You're just playing into his hands.

00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:37.145
Kim.

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:39.689
Hey.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.195
Mr. Seo, what are you trying to do here?

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.580
Let's take a seat first. Sit.

00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:56.873
Okay.

00:31:57.874 --> 00:31:59.834
But… are you sure…

00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:02.503
we're alone here?

00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:04.505
We are.

00:32:06.841 --> 00:32:08.176
Lies.

00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:13.181
Just turn all this off and leave us.

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.687
See that?

00:32:26.486 --> 00:32:27.654
I've never seen

00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:31.407
Detective Kim worked up like that
before in my life.

00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:33.993
I knew you looked us up and all,

00:32:34.077 --> 00:32:37.455
but I didn't expect you to even know
such details about Detective Kim's past.

00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:39.123
That's nothing.

00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:42.293
There are all sorts of documents
at the district office.

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.420
And I filled in
the missing pieces by myself.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.382
Why go after Kim Tae-seok?

00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:54.263
If that jerk had never been born,

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:56.808
my mom would've come back for me.

00:32:57.558 --> 00:32:58.559
I'm sure of it.

00:32:59.268 --> 00:33:00.645
Sure.

00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:02.355
So, did you…

00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:06.025
take a swing at Kim Tae-seok

00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:08.277
and kill him?

00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:16.411
The Mantis…

00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:24.669
What was your mom like?
What sort of person was she?

00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:29.382
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

00:33:31.426 --> 00:33:34.178
I know she wouldn't want that.

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:38.558
If I tell you,

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:42.311
will you tell me where Kim Tae-seok is?

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:53.489
Damn it.
Don't they know this is important?

00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:55.700
Let's keep it down over there.

00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.704
Just ignore them, Mr. Seo.

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:03.666
You know about
Jeong I-shin's life in prison, right?

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.086
With espresso. The prison guard told me.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.171
That happened

00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:11.424
because she negotiated with us.

00:34:11.507 --> 00:34:13.009
I'm proposing you do the same.

00:34:13.092 --> 00:34:15.303
Let's keep it a give-and-take, one by one.

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:19.182
I wouldn't make this proposal
if you weren't on the Mantis's level.

00:34:23.269 --> 00:34:24.270
So,

00:34:24.854 --> 00:34:27.106
tell me what you think about your mom.

00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:33.237
She's a criminal.

00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:42.497
Gosh.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.545
If he were 15 kilos,

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:52.006
he must have been about this big?

00:34:53.966 --> 00:34:55.343
What?

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.803
That's how much the kid weighed.

00:34:58.137 --> 00:34:59.931
I heard he was ten.

00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:07.063
His ankles were worn raw
with the bones showing.

00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:09.565
He was chained up.

00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:15.238
One of his nostrils was caved in.

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:18.282
When the kid's breathing
got on his nerves,

00:35:19.158 --> 00:35:21.994
he seared the kid with a hot spoon.

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.247
What are you talking about?

00:35:24.872 --> 00:35:27.083
That boy's father was
a beast masquerading as a man.

00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:29.460
She killed that bastard.

00:35:29.544 --> 00:35:31.295
The Queen Mantis did.

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:38.261
And you just call her a criminal?

00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:42.682
Fine. Let's just put it all on the table.

00:35:43.724 --> 00:35:45.351
You've killed someone before, right?

00:35:47.353 --> 00:35:49.397
Or at least attempted to?

00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:53.401
You damn brat!

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.447
Come on.
That's why you became a cop, right?

00:36:04.078 --> 00:36:05.246
Those eyes…

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:07.039
You're her son, all right.

00:36:21.304 --> 00:36:22.930
Such incredible insight.

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.932
I never thought of it that way.

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:28.769
As expected, you're quite astute.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.276
I feel like we're on
the same wavelength here.

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.819
Just throw me a bone here.

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:39.530
Where is Kim Tae-seok…

00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:41.073
No,

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:44.243
can you just tell me if he's alive or not?

00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:50.249
What now?

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.043
"Same wavelength"?

00:36:53.502 --> 00:36:54.879
We're on totally different ones.

00:36:57.423 --> 00:36:59.258
I shouldn't have missed that.

00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:00.426
Maybe I messed up?

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.596
It's pointless.

00:37:41.467 --> 00:37:43.177
We have no other choice. Let's take him.

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:48.182
He's a Mantis fanatic.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.185
He will talk in front of her.

00:37:54.146 --> 00:37:55.273
What?

00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:59.026
Must we keep relying
on Jeong I-shin like this?

00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:02.363
Passing off what she told me
as my own discovery

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:03.864
to the team feels wrong.

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:06.158
Not to mention, watching her

00:38:06.242 --> 00:38:09.453
throw us some scraps
and shrug us off is just…

00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:14.417
Damn it.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.501
Su-yeol.

00:38:17.586 --> 00:38:18.796
Back then…

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:44.113
There's something I didn't tell you
about what happened 23 years ago.

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.202
Here.

00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:52.371
Good job today.

00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:54.332
You don't need to give her that.

00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:56.250
It's fine.

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:58.169
Go on, say thank you.

00:38:58.252 --> 00:38:59.420
Thank you.

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:00.921
You're welcome.

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:02.840
Let's go. Say goodbye now.

00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:03.924
Goodbye.

00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.182
It's so obvious you love kids.

00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:12.391
No plans?

00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:15.561
Raising you is already a full-time job.
Latte?

00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:17.355
No. Black coffee for me.

00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:20.941
Do you really have no plans to have kids?

00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:22.735
I can just ask Su-yeol.

00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.613
Don't. He doesn't like
talking about that stuff.

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:28.240
I see… Cha Su-yeol is to blame.

00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:34.163
Don't people who grow up without parents
often try to make up for that loneliness

00:39:34.246 --> 00:39:35.790
with big families of their own?

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:38.417
Yeah. I'm like that.

00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:39.502
Sorry.

00:39:40.419 --> 00:39:43.214
I swear I didn't mean it like that.

00:39:43.297 --> 00:39:46.092
It's fine. I feel the same way too.

00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:50.721
Those thoughts grow stronger around
the anniversary of my parents' deaths.

00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:53.307
I do want to have kids.

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:57.812
But Su-yeol's memories
about his parents are…

00:39:58.562 --> 00:39:59.730
Not good?

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:02.024
He doesn't talk about it,

00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:04.026
but he sometimes calls
for his mom in his sleep.

00:40:05.486 --> 00:40:08.572
That tough detective looks
for his mommy in his sleep?

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:10.116
What a cutie pie.

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.412
If she were alive,
I could at least try to reconcile them.

00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:16.956
What? Don't be ridiculous.

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:19.417
Not having in-laws
is the biggest perk in the world.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.502
Must you put it like that?

00:40:22.711 --> 00:40:23.754
Hey.

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.633
Oh, that's right. You said black coffee.

00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:52.199
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:54.577
He's currently a suspect
in an ongoing investigation.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.954
I'm not sure bringing him here
was the right call.

00:41:00.499 --> 00:41:01.667
Just in case.

00:41:08.507 --> 00:41:10.217
So, we finally meet.

00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:14.263
Where are we?

00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:16.599
It doesn't look like a prison.

00:41:18.767 --> 00:41:20.519
I heard you imitated me.

00:41:22.188 --> 00:41:23.814
As close as humanly possible.

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:28.486
Why did you do it?

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:32.948
The world needs to know.

00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:34.825
Everything the Mantis did for them.

00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:40.247
They need to know how you dealt
with the scum of the earth.

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.333
They do.

00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:43.542
All of it.

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.421
I mean it.

00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:52.134
Is that so?

00:41:54.428 --> 00:41:55.930
How did it feel?

00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.934
Well… It was nice.

00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:02.603
I felt euphoria.

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:06.732
It was just as you told me.
It was nothing.

00:42:09.944 --> 00:42:11.529
But why did you use an ax?

00:42:12.071 --> 00:42:14.240
Didn't it end too quickly?

00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:16.992
That was because…

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.664
Well…

00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:28.003
The blood must have splattered
on your face.

00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:29.922
Did it?

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:32.675
How did it feel?

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:34.927
Well…

00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:37.263
It was…

00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:41.767
How long did life cling to him
after he was decapitated?

00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:43.644
About 20 seconds?

00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:46.522
Was it 30 seconds?

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.232
Well…

00:42:49.858 --> 00:42:51.026
Tell me.

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:54.905
You got to indulge because of me.
The least you can do is share.

00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:13.132
You're lying.

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.384
You…

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.761
never killed anyone.

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:19.388
No, I did.

00:43:19.471 --> 00:43:22.141
You made a gun for no reason, didn't you?
Because you were afraid.

00:43:22.224 --> 00:43:23.225
I…

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:24.727
You had no bullets.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.855
I knew it.

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.815
As if a nobody like you could imitate me.

00:43:31.233 --> 00:43:32.276
Get lost.

00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:33.777
No, I did kill.

00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:35.696
Kim Tae-seok, that prick…

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:38.991
He's dead.

00:43:39.074 --> 00:43:40.451
Probably.

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:44.455
"Probably dead"?

00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:49.043
What?

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:51.378
Did you just toss him
into the river or something?

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.631
With your eyes closed?

00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:55.966
Because you were afraid
to finish him yourself?

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.468
No, that's not true.

00:43:58.177 --> 00:43:59.178
Really?

00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:02.264
Where'd you do it? How'd you do it?

00:44:03.265 --> 00:44:04.642
Tell me.

00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:06.685
How did you do it?

00:44:08.437 --> 00:44:10.564
I fixed it.
Restored everything to its place.

00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:17.154
Of course, you can't tell me.
Because you didn't kill him.

00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:20.324
No gall to be found.

00:44:20.949 --> 00:44:22.159
And you were afraid.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.956
Yes. That's who you are.

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.292
Afraid of everything.

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.838
That's why your mother abandoned you.

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:39.218
She knew early on that you would grow up
to be this pathetic loser.

00:44:39.968 --> 00:44:41.136
Screw you!

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.805
Bitch.

00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:48.477
These jerks…

00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:53.232
Look at these jerks go.

00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:54.942
Why?

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:59.571
Oh, because of that cop son of yours?

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.159
Then, what about me?

00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:06.620
After I've come all this way,
following in your footsteps!

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:12.209
Oh, because we're not related by blood?

00:45:12.292 --> 00:45:15.212
Is that why you're acting like
a complete bitch?

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:16.964
I see.

00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:19.299
I will announce it to the whole world.

00:45:20.175 --> 00:45:23.220
Serial Killer Jeong I-shin is alive!

00:45:23.303 --> 00:45:27.182
And her son is Cha Su-yeol,
an active-duty police officer!

00:45:28.684 --> 00:45:31.270
Oh, and Lee Jung-yeon too!

00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:37.276
I will even tell the world
about that prick's wife!

00:45:39.027 --> 00:45:40.320
Damn it.

00:45:58.464 --> 00:45:59.465
Jeong I-shin!

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.389
Stop it!

00:46:07.473 --> 00:46:09.600
- Let go of him!
- I-shin!

00:46:09.683 --> 00:46:11.852
Stop! Let go of him!

00:46:14.813 --> 00:46:16.190
Hey! Wake up!

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.941
Seo Gu-wan! Wake up!

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:19.943
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.

00:46:20.027 --> 00:46:21.528
Dr. Park.

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:23.322
We need to end it.

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:25.824
We need to kill him now.

00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:29.286
You heard him. He knows everything.

00:46:29.369 --> 00:46:31.205
Wake up.

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.624
Seo Gu-wan! Are you okay?

00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:37.169
- Hey!
- Stop it, you punk!

00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:38.420
- Seo Gu-wan.
- Seo Gu-wan!

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:46.762
The gates are locked.

00:46:48.263 --> 00:46:49.264
Seo Gu-wan!

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.228
Don't come any closer, you pigs!

00:46:57.606 --> 00:47:00.067
You need to calm down
and set the gun down.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.027
- Shut up.
- Seo Gu-wan.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:04.071
This will only make things harder for you.

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.544
Who are you? Come out here.

00:47:18.627 --> 00:47:20.003
Come out now!

00:47:20.587 --> 00:47:22.631
Come out, you pricks!

00:47:22.714 --> 00:47:24.424
Hold on. Just wait.

00:47:25.217 --> 00:47:26.260
It's so noisy.

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:27.970
All of it.

00:47:29.972 --> 00:47:32.558
Yeah. Seo Gu-wan.

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:36.478
You're right. It's noisy.

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:41.441
You're not the only one who can hear it.
I can hear it too.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:42.609
Seo Gu-wan.

00:47:53.912 --> 00:47:54.997
I know.

00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:06.717
Lies.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:25.611
Commissioner,

00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:28.071
I'd like to thank you
from the bottom of my heart

00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:30.907
for saving me and my kids yesterday.

00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:33.869
But I still don't know
where my husband is right now.

00:48:33.952 --> 00:48:36.496
I'm worried something might've happened.

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.833
I haven't heard
anything about my husband yet.

00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:42.210
Please find him.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.213
Please, I beg you, Commissioner.

00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:46.965
Please save him!

00:48:47.049 --> 00:48:49.259
- Please…
- Oh, no!

00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:50.594
MANTIS

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:56.642
Hello?

00:48:56.725 --> 00:48:58.727
Okay. Understood.

00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:03.231
Kim Tae-seok's wife is at the gates
of the agency. It sounds like a mess.

00:49:04.066 --> 00:49:06.068
They said to stay inside
and keep out of the chaos.

00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:08.445
We didn't do anything wrong.

00:49:08.528 --> 00:49:09.655
Where are you going?

00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:11.865
We need to make Seo Gu-wan talk.

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:13.158
Seo Gu-wan isn't here.

00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:14.284
- What?
- What?

00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:16.995
Section Chief Choi and Captain Cha
took him somewhere.

00:49:17.079 --> 00:49:18.246
Did you not hear?

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:21.750
Damn it.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.128
AMBULANCE

00:49:25.212 --> 00:49:27.255
Sir. Can you hear us?

00:49:27.339 --> 00:49:29.132
You need to stay with us.

00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:31.843
What's his name?

00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:34.554
It's Seo Gu-wan.

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:35.764
Mr. Seo Gu-wan.

00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:38.934
Mr. Seo, you need to stay with us.

00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:40.852
- Where are you?
- Right behind you.

00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:42.187
How's Seo Gu-wan doing?

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:43.814
He's in bad shape, but conscious.

00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:46.024
You saw how he was with Jeong I-shin.

00:49:46.108 --> 00:49:48.110
He is not the copycat killer.

00:49:48.193 --> 00:49:49.820
The issue is Kim Tae-seok.

00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:51.863
We need to get Seo to talk quickly.

00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:53.990
As long as Kim is safe,
there will be no casualties.

00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:56.076
The media will forget about
Seo Gu-wan soon enough.

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.786
What if he doesn't talk?

00:49:57.869 --> 00:49:59.246
We have to make him.

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.081
What if he speaks nonsense?

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:03.083
What if it's nothing about Kim and…

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:04.960
Mr. Seo. Can you hear us?

00:50:05.043 --> 00:50:07.003
What if he wants to talk about me
and that woman?

00:50:07.087 --> 00:50:09.131
Don't worry.
I spoke to the hospital director.

00:50:09.214 --> 00:50:11.883
Jeong I-shin was also treated there
during her prison sentence.

00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.261
Seo Gu-wan will be kept
completely hidden from the world.

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:15.595
Right now, Kim Tae-seok is--

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:17.514
Detective Kim is calling.

00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:18.682
Just bend the truth.

00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:20.225
Blood pressure is 90 over 50.

00:50:20.308 --> 00:50:23.019
Pulse is at 124…

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:25.605
Pardon?

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:28.567
Yes, understood.

00:50:30.152 --> 00:50:31.236
What did he say?

00:50:32.404 --> 00:50:35.282
He said Seo tried
to kill himself in his cell.

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:37.743
They're transporting him to the hospital.

00:50:37.826 --> 00:50:38.827
What?

00:50:39.745 --> 00:50:40.912
Is he hurt badly?

00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:43.582
What a pain in the ass he is.

00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:46.376
Mr. Seo, we're almost there.

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.254
We need to end it.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.800
You heard him. He knows everything.

00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:58.388
Lee Jung-yeon too!

00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:04.269
I will even tell the world
about that prick's wife!

00:51:04.352 --> 00:51:06.980
We need to kill him now.

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:09.941
- Mr. Seo.
- Mr. Seo!

00:51:10.025 --> 00:51:11.026
What's wrong with him?

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:13.779
- What's wrong?
- It's cardiac arrest.

00:51:13.862 --> 00:51:15.489
Can you give me a hand? One, two,

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.783
- …three, four, five.
- Mr. Seo.

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:18.950
Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:19.034 --> 00:51:20.994
No, you can't. Seo Gu-wan!

00:51:51.358 --> 00:51:52.359
How's he doing?

00:51:56.404 --> 00:51:57.948
Luckily, the bullet only grazed him,

00:51:58.031 --> 00:52:00.325
but his skull was fractured,
so there was some bleeding.

00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:02.077
They treated it.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.246
He's alive, but he needs strict bed rest.

00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:07.999
He's in a room by himself
with a hospital security guard.

00:52:08.083 --> 00:52:10.627
Security will be tight. Don't worry.

00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:18.718
Seo Gu-wan…

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.930
When Jeong I-shin asked him
about what he did with Kim Tae-seok,

00:52:22.013 --> 00:52:23.890
he didn't say he was killed or dead.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.642
He said, "probably dead."

00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:28.687
Do you remember how uncertain he sounded?

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.522
No, I did kill.

00:52:31.106 --> 00:52:32.440
Kim Tae-seok, that prick…

00:52:33.024 --> 00:52:34.025
He's dead.

00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:35.402
Probably.

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.578
What?

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.289
Did you just toss him
into the river or something?

00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:49.249
Sir.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.503
He couldn't refute her.

00:52:53.587 --> 00:52:55.255
If he had really killed Kim,

00:52:56.298 --> 00:52:57.799
he would've spoken up.

00:52:59.634 --> 00:53:02.679
What if Seo Gu-wan left Kim Tae-seok

00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:05.307
in a place where he would inevitably die

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.809
without outside intervention?

00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:10.645
What if Seo just abandoned him there?

00:53:13.106 --> 00:53:16.443
Then, there's a chance
that Kim could be alive somewhere.

00:53:17.068 --> 00:53:19.029
That means we still have time.

00:53:21.656 --> 00:53:25.368
The only one who knows where that would be
is in there, in that condition.

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:31.499
I fixed it.

00:53:32.459 --> 00:53:33.793
Restored everything to its place.

00:53:36.588 --> 00:53:38.423
What? What is it?

00:53:39.424 --> 00:53:40.717
I think…

00:53:41.509 --> 00:53:42.844
Su-yeol, what is it?

00:53:44.179 --> 00:53:45.221
Hey, Ji-an.

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:48.725
What is this?

00:53:48.808 --> 00:53:50.226
YEONAM MEDICAL CENTER

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.897
He took a picture of the same hospital
every year since 2007.

00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:59.402
Seo believes Kim Tae-seok stole his life.

00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:01.237
He believes their lives
have been switched.

00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:02.322
And…

00:54:03.323 --> 00:54:05.659
Before Seo tried to take his own life,
he told us,

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:09.120
Kim was "probably dead."
Not, "I killed him."

00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:11.706
He said everything
was restored to its place.

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:13.667
If Seo didn't do the killing himself,

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.920
but locked Kim up somewhere until he died,

00:54:17.003 --> 00:54:20.006
it would be somewhere Seo believed
was the origin of his despair.

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:23.218
The hospital where he was abandoned.
Don't you think?

00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:25.762
Just look at these photos.

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:30.183
For years, he obsessively took
photos of this one place.

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:33.269
That must mean this place
is meaningful to him.

00:54:34.479 --> 00:54:37.357
What do the rest of you think?

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.484
Two days after someone goes missing,

00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:41.111
their survival rate goes down to 30%.

00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:42.445
We don't have time to waste.

00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:44.280
Please believe in me and follow my lead.

00:54:44.864 --> 00:54:46.574
I haven't led you astray yet.

00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:50.370
"Believe"? This is an investigation,
not a church service.

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.455
Is conviction enough
in a narcotics investigation?

00:54:52.998 --> 00:54:54.124
Stop. That's enough.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.962
Let's head out first.

00:54:59.045 --> 00:55:00.797
We should check if there's any doubt.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.466
And Captain Cha's theory isn't outlandish.

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.885
All right.
Let's do whatever we can. Head out.

00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:07.762
After you arrive, check in often.

00:55:08.263 --> 00:55:09.389
You heard him.

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.933
Yeonam Medical Center
at Hongshin Intersection. Move it.

00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:24.195
He must have imitated
Jeong I-shin's murder.

00:55:24.279 --> 00:55:26.823
The third murder was a drowning.
Assuming he attempted that,

00:55:26.906 --> 00:55:28.408
we need to look for places with water.

00:55:28.491 --> 00:55:29.492
Let's go.

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:50.430
AQUATIC PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM

00:56:03.401 --> 00:56:05.195
I'm from the Nambu Police Agency.

00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:13.078
The basement is clear.

00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:24.214
SHOWER ROOM

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.559
- Laundry room is clear.
- Did you find anything?

00:56:36.643 --> 00:56:38.061
He's not here.

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:40.814
What now? Should I check the sink too?

00:56:40.897 --> 00:56:42.148
Let's go.

00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:54.160
We're on a wild goose chase.

00:57:00.291 --> 00:57:03.086
Let's just grill Seo Gu-wan
until he talks.

00:57:03.169 --> 00:57:05.421
He is in a coma after a suicide attempt.

00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:07.632
But isn't continuing
to investigate this place

00:57:07.715 --> 00:57:09.801
when there's nothing to find also a waste?

00:57:09.884 --> 00:57:11.594
Ji-an, did you find anything?

00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:13.263
Nothing yet.

00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:15.723
I combed through all the footage
for the past few days.

00:57:15.807 --> 00:57:17.225
Seo Gu-wan is nowhere to be found.

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:19.894
He has to be here.

00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:21.187
No, I did kill.

00:57:21.271 --> 00:57:22.689
Kim Tae-seok, that prick…

00:57:24.357 --> 00:57:25.442
He's dead.

00:57:26.192 --> 00:57:27.485
Probably.

00:57:28.903 --> 00:57:30.655
He couldn't see it through.

00:57:31.656 --> 00:57:34.451
He must have abandoned him
in a life-threatening situation.

00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:36.536
INTERNAL MEDICINE,
SURGERY, OB-GYN

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.038
FLOOR GUIDE

00:57:45.003 --> 00:57:47.380
Pardon me.

00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:50.758
Is this on its way
to the ward laundry room?

00:57:50.842 --> 00:57:53.178
That place is too small for all this.

00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:54.387
There's a laundry plant.

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.556
That's not listed on the floor guide.

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:59.684
Why would they
if no one ever wants to go there?

00:58:00.185 --> 00:58:01.811
Where is it?

00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:06.608
- I'm downloading it now.
- Good job.

00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:09.444
Well? Let's just go back without him.

00:58:09.527 --> 00:58:11.905
We can't just go by ourselves.
What about Captain Cha?

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.490
Laundry plant.

00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:18.161
What?

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:23.833
Sung-gyu, you go that way.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.802
Captain!

00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:53.363
Mr. Kim Tae-seok!

00:58:53.446 --> 00:58:54.739
Sung-gyu!

00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:01.287
Sung-gyu, call for a doctor.

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:03.331
You can't die.

00:59:06.543 --> 00:59:07.627
Kim Tae-seok!

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:14.926
You can't die.

00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:18.680
You can't die.

00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:21.266
Please.

00:59:22.183 --> 00:59:23.851
You can't!

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:35.590
{\an8}So many damn mirrors.
It's like 4DX in here.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.175
{\an8}It must be a message for us.

01:00:37.258 --> 01:00:40.428
{\an8}"Stop going after the wrong guy
and making a fool of yourself."

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:41.846
{\an8}I just saw you on the news.

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:43.181
{\an8}Tell me you didn't see your mom again.

01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:46.267
{\an8}Lee Jung-yeon.
Does she know about me as well?

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:47.935
{\an8}And this "zero" section.

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.396
{\an8}There's just a number with nothing else.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.106
{\an8}That number can't be meaningless.

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:54.525
{\an8}The "first" murder we do not know about.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:56.235
{\an8}How would Seo Gu-wan know about that?

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.196
{\an8}There's another beyond the original five,
isn't there?

01:00:58.821 --> 01:00:59.822
{\an8}Jeong I-shin!

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:04.577
