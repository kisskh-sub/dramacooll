00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.596
- Miss.
- Ask her what is wrong.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.723
- I have no idea.
- Miss!

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.309
- What made you so angry?
- I'll kill you all!

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.146
What is this noise?

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.899
The palace was quiet for a while.

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.485
His Majesty must have
called the performers again.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:12.489
The palace is full of unrest as it is.
I doubt it is the performers.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.990
We have been here long enough.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.159
It is obviously the performers.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.703
{\an8}Let us hurry and prepare
His Majesty's chojoban

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.914
{\an8}before he reprimands us
for serving him late.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.083
{\an8}CHOJOBAN: EARLY MORNING MEAL
THAT USUALLY INCLUDES SOOTHING FOOD

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.542
Sure.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.472
What are you doing?

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:38.807
You are scaring me.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.773
Good morning.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:54.739
I have no idea
why she stayed up all night doing that.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.952
I must go to Saongwon,
Office of Royal Meals.

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.538
Then take me with you.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.917
Man-su, it seems we are out of firewood.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.044
Oh no. That is not good news.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.507
What is the matter, miss?

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.633
Look at your face.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.805
What happened
that made you look so haggard?

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.310
There is no one but us now, so tell me.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.730
- You're so dead!
- My goodness!

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.448
Do I have to cook hangover soup
for that punk?

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:41.077
It's such a shame
I don't have gochugaru, chili powder.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.205
Poor dried pollack.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.499
It died twice.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:50.086
Miss, what are you making
that requires such work?

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:51.880
What?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.800
I was going to cook
dried pollack hangover soup,

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.303
but this is an insult to the fish.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.596
- Right?
- Yes.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.515
I am embarrassed to face it. Oh dear.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.767
Take this, Gil-geum.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:06.603
What for?

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:09.355
I'm going to

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:13.526
turn all this into powder.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.488
I'm going to destroy you!

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.034
Miss!

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:31.127
COURSE N° 5 SNOWFLAKE SCHNITZEL

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.841
{\an8}Your Majesty, your chojoban is ready.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.343
{\an8}Bring it in.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.236
{\an8}YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:58.905
{\an8}Your Majesty, are you all right?

00:03:58.988 --> 00:03:59.822
{\an8}You are here.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.171
You had too much to drink last night,

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.383
{\an8}so I prepared a dried pollack consommé
to soothe your hangover.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:19.759
{\an8}CONSOMMÉ: A FRENCH-STYLE CLEAR SOUP

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:29.852
A dried pollack consumed in hay?

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.312
Yes.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.315
It's a French-style soup
made with dried pollack.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.654
A soup made with dried pollack?

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.448
- Taste it.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.545
CHOI MAL-IM
KING'S SENIOR COURT LADY

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:22.989
Did you not say

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.700
this was a dried pollack soup?

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.411
Where is the dried pollack?

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:32.123
I crushed the fish into small pieces
to make it easier to eat.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:33.875
Have some more.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.877
See if you feel anything bothering you.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.712
Though I'm sure you won't feel anything.

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:43.426
Everyone but the chief royal cook
may leave.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.136
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:55.521
Tell me.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.565
Did something happen last night?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.819
I was going to ask you.

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.406
Do you not remember

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.741
what happened last night?

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.995
Well, I was drinking.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.623
And then?

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.250
One drinks to forget.

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:18.211
So why would I remember anything?

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:24.592
So you're saying
you don't remember anything at all, right?

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:27.470
How dare you?
You are speaking out of line.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.679
Why do you keep asking?

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.517
"Stay as you are."

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:35.895
"Just for a while."

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:38.397
You don't remember that?

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.274
What was that?

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.154
I'd rather not explain any further.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.405
Are you done?

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.408
Why are you acting like this?

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:51.077
Tell it to me straight.

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.457
Your Majesty.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.627
Let me make one thing very clear.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.964
You're not my style at all, okay?

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:04.882
What? Not your sty?

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.468
No. I'm talking about ideal types.

00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:08.761
The type that I like.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:13.057
You're not at all
the kind of man that I like.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.519
Have you forgotten?

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:19.730
You are my chief royal cook.

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.566
That means

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:25.695
I do not see you as a woman.

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:28.281
That's perfect.

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.450
So what is there to make clear?

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.078
I'm so sick and tired of this.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.330
I won't beat around the bush.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.415
Your Majesty.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.418
From now on, watch where you… No.

00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:43.171
Watch out
when you drink at night, all right?

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:44.964
Very well.

00:07:45.756 --> 00:07:47.383
I will be careful when I drink at night.

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.556
- Take the food away.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.575
My goodness.

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:21.083
Chang-seon.

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.962
CHANG-SEON
CHIEF EUNUCH OF ROYAL FOOD

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.547
Did you ask for me, Your Majesty?

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:28.674
Did something happen

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.260
to the chief royal cook
at Unyeongjeong last night?

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:40.394
Yesterday, she…

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.854
What happened to her?

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:43.481
Well…

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:48.319
You laid your lips upon hers,
Your Majesty.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.201
I laid my lips
upon the chief royal cook's own?

00:08:57.578 --> 00:08:59.080
I brought your juansang--

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:00.373
Stay still.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:03.334
Your Majesty…

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:05.336
Stay as you are.

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:06.420
Just for a while.

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:16.514
Do you not remember
what happened last night?

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:17.848
Your Majesty, from now on,

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.142
watch out
when you drink at night, all right?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:23.354
What on earth do I do about this?

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:28.484
It would be better for us both
to ignore what happened.

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:31.487
No. Considering what I did to her,

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:33.906
it would be best to soothe her anger.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.907
Wait.

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:36.742
Why should I

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:39.287
even worry about this?

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.414
I am the king of this nation,

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.791
and Cook Yeon is just my cook.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.838
The more I think about it,
the less sense it makes.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.728
He doesn't remember, huh?

00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.481
Man, how ridiculous. That punk.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.027
I understand he blacked out,

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.446
but how can he be so shameless?

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:15.823
I didn't even expect an apology.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.159
This is just absurd.

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:19.660
Is something bothering you?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:24.665
Why are you mumbling to yourself?

00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:28.461
Who are you? Do you know me?

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:29.629
GONG-GIL
YEONHUIGUN'S JESTER WITH MANY SECRETS

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:31.922
Do you not recognize me?

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:33.799
I asked because I don't.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.094
Surely you're not a new cook.

00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:46.395
What the heck?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.194
You're that jester from the other night.

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:55.071
Gong-gil?

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:55.988
That is right.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.617
I apologize for startling you that night.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.618
Did you

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.205
come here to deceive me
and call it another performance?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.792
Let me tell you something.

00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:11.170
I got promoted to chief royal cook.

00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:12.713
It's a sixth-rank junior position.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.216
{\an8}The head of the royal kitchen.

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:17.093
{\an8}That sure is intimidating.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.220
{\an8}A sixth-rank junior official.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:22.848
Are you laughing?

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.558
I'm warning you right now.

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:26.102
Very well.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:29.355
I will not mock you again.

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:33.359
By the way, is that maid all right?

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.486
Gil-geum, was it?

00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:37.738
Someone suddenly hit me and made me fall.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.240
That's when I smacked my head
on the ground.

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:42.493
A man suddenly appeared
and shouted at the culprit.

00:11:42.576 --> 00:11:46.747
It was the handsome jester, Gong-gil.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:47.706
Oh.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.001
Yes. Gil-geum is fine and well.

00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:54.755
Did you see who did that to her?

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:56.674
I did not see.

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:58.384
However,

00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:01.178
the color of her attire
was that of a court lady.

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.472
I saw the hem of her skirt, you see.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.974
A court lady?

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:06.434
Who on earth would do that?

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:09.937
Tell Gil-geum to watch out for a while.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.856
I will.

00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:15.276
Gil-geum is grateful for your help.

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.444
It was nothing at all.

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.655
I only ran into her
while looking for someone.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.115
Who were you looking for?

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:24.201
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:26.287
Okay.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.038
Goodbye then.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:30.833
I hope to see you again, Chief Royal Cook.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.628
What's wrong with him?

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.423
This place is filled with weirdos.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:39.508
I just can't get used to this.

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:47.683
Who is that?

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:13.792
She was taken to Jahongwon
and returned home dead.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.712
This is all because of that damned king!

00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:21.425
You said you would live a comfortable life
in the palace.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:23.552
Why did you come back dead?

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:27.389
Ok-dan…

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.823
If I watch you closely,

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:47.326
I will soon find out.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.371
After all, I have found the owner

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.500
of the binyeo that my older sister
held tight even in death.

00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:58.087
Are you certain

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.632
that Gong-gil did not see you
during the competition?

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:04.510
Yes, Your Grace. Do not concern yourself.

00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:09.431
Could it be that the lowly jester
has grown fond of the gwinyeo?

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:14.228
How interesting.

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:18.691
If the jester has secretly developed
feelings for the gwinyeo,

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:21.026
he will get in the way at every turn.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.989
Get someone who can be trusted
to find out all they can about Gong-gil.

00:14:25.072 --> 00:14:28.617
I must find out why he suddenly
took a part in the gwinyeo's affairs.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:29.702
Yes, Your Grace.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.245
Also,

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:34.415
tell the chief eunuch
that I wish to speak with His Majesty

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:37.334
after the morning assembly today.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.296
Yes, Your Grace. I will tell him so.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:44.508
Your Majesty,

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.969
I believe the letters from the ministers
require your immediate attention.

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:49.054
What are these letters of appeal about?

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:50.931
It is a request that you reduce

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:53.601
the amount of ginseng
the Hwanghae Governor renders tribute.

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:56.395
They want the amount to be reduced?

00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:59.481
Yes, Your Majesty. Ginseng smuggling
has recently become rampant in Kaesong,

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:01.859
and they are short on supply
to send to the palace.

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:05.529
Moreover, the Ming envoy
who will reach Hanyang in four days

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.907
is thought to mention this matter as well.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.824
What?

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.410
As if buying Joseon ginseng
in secret is not enough,

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:13.996
they will make it a diplomatic issue?

00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:17.416
Does the Ming want all the ginseng
Joseon can grow?

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.960
Nothing is for sure yet.

00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:21.420
Please calm yourself, Your Majesty.

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:24.381
Tell me.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.926
Who is the chief envoy this time?

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:30.054
The leader of the Imperial Eight,
also known as the eight directors

00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:31.639
{\an8}who seized power
with the Emperor's support…

00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.140
{\an8}THE IMPERIAL EIGHT: EIGHT EUNUCHS
(DIRECTORS) FAVORED BY THE MING EMPEROR

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:34.600
{\an8}…Yu Kun.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:38.395
Yu Kun?

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:39.688
Is he not the eunuch

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.608
who punished the Ming envoy
who returned after agreeing

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.402
to no longer take Joseon women as tribute
two years ago?

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:46.487
It is he, Your Majesty.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.530
What is he scheming?

00:15:49.573 --> 00:15:53.369
Why would that man
come in person as a chief envoy?

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.913
Find out exactly
what his true intent could be.

00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:57.039
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:16:00.209
I will send word
to the reception official and find out.

00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:09.802
Your Majesty.

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:11.679
Last night,

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.723
while partaking in your juansang,

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.142
you and the chief royal…

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:21.397
- Please forget it, Your Majesty.
- Do not stop midway.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.648
Continue.

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.698
Is it true that while partaking
in your juansang last night,

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:32.825
you and the chief royal cook…

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.917
Is it true that you did that?

00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.462
What?

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:48.090
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
Let us head to the morning assembly.

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:49.425
No, wait!

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:52.553
Come here.

00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:01.478
I had a lot to drink,

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:05.482
and I think I bestowed
the brazen woman with my favor.

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.651
However, instead of being grateful,

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:10.029
her already unattractive face
is brimming with spite.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.990
I cannot stand the sight.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.201
How dare you laugh at me?

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.038
Your Majesty.

00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:22.708
Women, by nature,
are easily swayed by gifts.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:23.709
Gifts?

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.586
Is it not enough that I bestowed my favor?

00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:27.129
Must I also give her a gift?

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:29.256
If her unattractive face
were to become even more unattractive,

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.926
it would torment you to have to
look at it every day, would it not?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:35.220
It would indeed.

00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:37.514
Then tell me.

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.517
What should I give someone like her
to make her feel better?

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:42.853
Silk?

00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:44.480
A binyeo, hairpin?

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:45.939
Or a ring?

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:47.191
No, not those things.

00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:51.445
You cannot gift a woman just anything,
Your Majesty.

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:52.404
Then what?

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:53.822
What is most important

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.617
is that you find out what she likes
and give her that.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.787
How am I to know what she likes?

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.038
That is why

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:04.208
women are hard to grasp.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:07.127
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager
prefers books to jewels,

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:10.005
and Her Grace Consort Kang
prefers jewels to books.

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:13.425
They are both women,
and yet they like different things.

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:17.179
I respectfully advise you
to ponder this carefully, Your Majesty.

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:23.352
Your Majesty.

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.355
A group of envoys will arrive in Hanyang
four days from today

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.273
with an edict from the Ming Emperor.

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:29.191
So I heard.

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:31.401
How are the preparations going?

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.987
A temporary reception office
has been set up,

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:36.365
{\an8}and Second Minister of Rites
Yoo Hyeong-min left for Yangju

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.617
{\an8}with a retinue to do his duty
as the reception official.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.537
The envoy's route from the entrance
to the capital, Namdaemun,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.789
{\an8}to Taepyeonggwan, Official Reception Hall,
has been cleaned.

00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:46.125
Furthermore, to entertain the envoys,

00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:49.753
we summoned a great many jesters
for a grand welcome celebration.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.673
Once the official business is done,
we will float boats on the Han River

00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:56.802
{\an8}where the envoys can write
and exchange poems with our scholars.

00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.847
{\an8}What about the preparations
for the farewell ceremony?

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.558
{\an8}We prepared gifts
for them to take on their return,

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:07.062
{\an8}including 200 pieces of silver bullion.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.063
{\an8}What?

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.565
{\an8}Two hundred pieces of silver?

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:10.983
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:12.359
That is not all.

00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:14.319
The silver must be taken to the border,

00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:17.364
and that requires eight men per cart,
a total of around sixty men.

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:20.409
It will reduce
what is in our coffers by half.

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:21.493
Your Majesty.

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:24.454
This is something that must be done

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:26.165
to sustain our amicable relationship
with the Ming.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:29.334
However, it is true
that 200 pieces of silver are too much.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:33.046
That is right. The previous envoy
did not return with that much silver.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.466
The previous envoy was a civil official
well-known in the Ming,

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.927
and he did not care much
for monetary goods.

00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:40.888
However, the envoy
we are expecting this time

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:44.850
is known for being haughty and greedy,
even in his homeland.

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:47.019
{\an8}An excess can be remedied later on,

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.438
but we will not have time
to make up for a deficiency.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:52.566
It is only right to be well-prepared.

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:55.235
I agree with the Chief State Councilor.

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:57.696
We do not yet know
what the envoy will demand,

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:00.574
and we cannot ignore
their authority and influence.

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:02.618
Would it not be best to host the envoys

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.953
- without incident?
- Enough!

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.375
That is enough.

00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:11.543
Our state coffers

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.213
are filled with the blood, sweat,

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:16.381
and hard work of my people.

00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:17.841
And yet

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.719
you have no plans to secure our resources

00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:24.264
and only aim to pander to them
and cower before their whims.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.141
You do not know what he will demand,

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:28.435
so you prepared gifts
and 200 pieces of silver?

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:35.275
And you still claim that you are acting
in the people's interest?

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.194
Can you, without shame,

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:39.821
say that you are acting in the interest
of the country and its people?

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.323
However, Your Majesty,

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.825
we cannot simply demand our wishes

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:46.411
- when it comes to diplomatic issues.
- The taxes paid by the Joseon people

00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:49.373
belong to the Joseon royal family.

00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:53.252
Prepare only the minimum of gifts
and silver bullion,

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:55.545
and keep the reception of the envoys

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:57.756
in the most modest manner.

00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:01.385
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:05.180
- We will do as you command.
- We will do as you command.

00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:11.895
Your Majesty.

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:15.524
Step back.

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:16.900
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:20.153
What is it?

00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:24.574
Yi Jang-gyun was found collapsed
at Banchon Village this morning.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.327
- Is he alive?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:29.663
He is unconscious
due to the severe injury.

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:30.789
Where is he now?

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.126
What about the draft?

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:36.169
I did not find it.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:39.381
I took him somewhere safe
and had a physician treat him.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.299
And?

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.551
He disappeared without a trace.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.970
- He disappeared?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:47.347
There were no signs of an intrusion,

00:21:47.431 --> 00:21:49.558
so it seems he got away on his own.

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:53.186
Where would an injured man go?

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:57.524
Someone must still be after his life.

00:21:58.025 --> 00:21:58.859
I am certain of it.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.111
Who?

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:02.988
Who would do this?

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:07.951
Select a few nimble,
tight-lipped soldiers and find him.

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:09.745
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:12.289
You must hurry.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.213
Your Majesty.

00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:23.675
Her Grace Consort Kang
wishes to have an audience with you.

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:25.886
I shall escort you to Jahongwon.

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:27.387
I do not

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.557
wish to see anyone today.

00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:32.476
But Your Majesty…

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.810
Your Majesty.

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:38.940
These are butterfly hairpins.

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:40.901
Yes, I like these.

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.739
Leave us.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.039
What is it?

00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:56.166
His Majesty left the hall of governance,

00:22:57.417 --> 00:22:59.086
but he is headed to his chambers.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.170
What?

00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:04.382
Did the chief eunuch inform him
that I wished to see him?

00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:05.425
Yes, Your Grace.

00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:10.639
So this is how he chooses to act.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:19.689
Drag the queen out!

00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:21.024
Let go of me!

00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:23.318
How dare you do this to me?

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.696
Your Majesty, how could you--

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.366
Enough! Drag her away!

00:23:29.449 --> 00:23:31.535
- Let go of me.
- Please stand up, Your Majesty.

00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:33.995
Your Majesty!

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.748
A king is one who fathoms.

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:40.627
He must fathom his family, the heavens,

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.672
and the hearts of others.

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:44.881
What does fathom mean?

00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:49.177
You will understand
what that means when you grow up.

00:23:53.223 --> 00:23:54.224
Your Majesty.

00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:56.893
This is the way to the royal kitchen.

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:13.743
Why did I come here?

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:16.246
Are you going to eat or not? Open up.

00:24:16.329 --> 00:24:18.748
I'm glad to see you enjoying it.

00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:22.377
I'm sure you had
a lot to think about today.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.838
It's just like how being a king
comes with perks,

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:28.341
but also challenges and hardships.

00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:32.345
Why am I thinking of you

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.724
when my heart feels heavy?

00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:58.413
Someone must still be after his life.
I am certain of it.

00:24:58.496 --> 00:25:01.416
Not even I have seen
the draft of the historical record.

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:06.546
So who is chasing Principal Drafter Yi
so viciously and why?

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:10.467
Your Majesty, it is I, Court Lady Choi.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.509
You may enter.

00:25:17.974 --> 00:25:19.017
Your Majesty.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:21.853
- Your seoksura, evening meal--
- Leave it.

00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:23.146
Pardon?

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.106
- Then--
- Enough.

00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:27.984
I do not

00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:31.780
wish to eat anything tonight.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.740
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:52.425
His Majesty remains in his chambers
without eating his meal?

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.637
Something does not feel right.

00:25:57.013 --> 00:25:59.766
Did you hear that last night,

00:25:59.849 --> 00:26:03.478
he touched lips with the chief royal cook
who brought his juansang to Unyeongjeong?

00:26:03.561 --> 00:26:04.771
Yes, Your Grace.

00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:07.148
However, His Majesty was drunk--

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.526
It was not purely because he was drunk.

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:11.444
All incidents are preceded by a sign.

00:26:12.028 --> 00:26:12.862
Then…

00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:16.283
The chief royal cook's presence itself
is a thorn in my side.

00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:18.118
What would you like to be done?

00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:19.869
If he will not see me,

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.123
I have no choice but to go see him myself.

00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:26.418
{\an8}His Majesty's physical examination
is coming up, is it not?

00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:28.295
{\an8}Yes. It is in two days' time.

00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:30.422
{\an8}Grand Prince Jesan
will visit the palace that day.

00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:31.548
What if

00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:36.011
I served His Majesty a meal that day?

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:39.723
It would be the perfect way
to win back His Majesty's favor.

00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:43.727
What should I serve him?

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.398
His Majesty will skip his seoksura.

00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:49.316
Okay.

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:52.277
Wait, what?
He's skipping his evening meal? Why?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.029
I do not know why,

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:57.198
but His Majesty said not to bring in
any food today.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.784
He won't eat? That's odd.

00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:01.077
It sure is.

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:03.830
He rarely misses a meal.

00:27:03.913 --> 00:27:05.290
It truly is worrisome.

00:27:05.373 --> 00:27:07.459
I'll prepare his meal anyway.

00:27:07.542 --> 00:27:09.252
If he refuses to eat, so be it.

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:10.420
Do you have a good idea?

00:27:10.503 --> 00:27:12.422
I have to at least try.

00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:13.590
Yes, do that.

00:27:13.673 --> 00:27:14.716
I shall get going.

00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:17.469
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Eunuch Yoon.

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:20.847
- Oh dear. What do we do?
- Let's go.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.475
- What was that?
- Le…

00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:24.976
- What?
- Lego!

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:33.651
This competition was the chance
to replace the chief royal cook.

00:27:33.735 --> 00:27:35.236
I have no excuse for my failure,
Your Grace.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.406
This is your last chance
to become the chief royal cook.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.825
Your Grace. This is…

00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:42.285
{\an8}It is arsenic.

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:44.371
{\an8}Watch for the right time

00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:46.790
{\an8}and add that to the meal
the gwinyeo makes for His Majesty.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.341
SEOKSURA

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:00.887
{\an8}CHICKEN FRICASSEE
A FRENCH CREAM STEW WITH CHICKEN

00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:03.056
What?

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.394
CHOJOBAN

00:28:07.977 --> 00:28:10.980
{\an8}Your Majesty. Your chojoban is ready.

00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:17.153
He really should try this though.

00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:22.659
NATGEOTSANG

00:28:23.743 --> 00:28:26.079
{\an8}Your Majesty, your natgeotsang,
daytime meal, is ready.

00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:34.921
SEOKSURA

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:45.682
What a long day it was.

00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:50.603
- You did well today.
- You too, Gil-geum.

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:57.360
Oh, are you not going inside?

00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:59.362
No. You go ahead.

00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:02.615
- Okay. Do not stay out too long.
- Okay.

00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:13.334
How did I end up like this?

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:17.005
It feels like yesterday
that I won La Poêle d'Or.

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:19.549
This feels so unreal.

00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:28.391
I wonder how Dad is doing.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.394
I miss him.

00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:38.151
I hope he's not skipping meals
like His Majesty is.

00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:56.377
Oh my. I must be losing my mind.

00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:04.803
What did I just see?

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:08.306
Isn't he hungry at all?

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:10.099
Food is what keeps us going.

00:30:10.683 --> 00:30:12.811
What on earth is making him skip meals?

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.604
Goodness.

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:25.698
Oh, our dear princess,

00:30:25.782 --> 00:30:27.742
is this little bite good enough for you?
Here you go.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.119
This is what we call "tableside service."

00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:32.330
Watching and enjoying
the food being prepared before your eyes

00:30:32.413 --> 00:30:33.790
stimulates the appetite.

00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:34.874
I'll show you.

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.293
Open your mouth.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:47.345
Am I thinking of you because I am hungry,

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:50.807
or am I hungry
because I am thinking of you?

00:30:55.937 --> 00:30:57.438
I cannot tell.

00:31:01.901 --> 00:31:02.735
Chang-seon.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.198
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:09.951
When will they serve my evening meal?

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:10.869
Pardon?

00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:15.248
Did you just ask about your evening meal,
Your Majesty?

00:31:15.331 --> 00:31:16.249
Yes.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:19.878
I am hungry.

00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:28.928
Your Majesty, your seoksura is ready.

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.263
Bring it in.

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.706
It has been a while, Chief Royal Cook.

00:31:58.041 --> 00:32:00.835
Yes. It has been a while, Your Majesty.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:04.756
So, what did you bring me this evening?

00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:08.051
You didn't eat at all today,

00:32:08.134 --> 00:32:10.720
so I made chicken soup
to soothe your stomach.

00:32:13.848 --> 00:32:17.560
{\an8}CHICKEN SOUP: A CLEAR CHICKEN BROTH
WITH MEAT AND VEGETABLES

00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:19.145
"Swoop"?

00:32:19.228 --> 00:32:22.732
It's like a rice gruel
flavored with chicken broth.

00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:24.734
They call it "soup" in foreign countries.

00:32:25.818 --> 00:32:27.445
In case you get an upset stomach,

00:32:27.528 --> 00:32:28.988
I only prepared dongchimi,
radish water kimchi,

00:32:29.072 --> 00:32:31.324
as an easily-digestible side dish
to spark your appetite.

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.203
Taste it.

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.704
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.157
It is delicious.

00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:55.033
What is this feeling?
Why do I feel so proud?

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:18.806
Why does my heart

00:34:20.808 --> 00:34:22.226
race so fast

00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:24.812
when I see you?

00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:31.819
{\an8}GRAND PRINCE JESAN'S RESIDENCE

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.029
{\an8}Was it not

00:34:33.112 --> 00:34:37.075
the anniversary of your younger brother
Kim I-son's death recently?

00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.242
It was, Your Highness.

00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:41.370
He died so suddenly.

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:43.498
Your brother passed so suddenly

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:45.875
during the Muin Literati Purge,

00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:47.502
as well as my friends

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.338
and the brothers of many officials.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.298
That is why

00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:55.551
we got together, did we not?

00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:57.470
Yes, Your Highness.

00:34:58.679 --> 00:34:59.931
Then why

00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:04.560
did you send an assassin
to Salgoji Forest without my permission?

00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:09.440
With your family
almost wiped out because of the purge,

00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:14.028
I am sure you were ashamed
to have survived by yourself

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:15.571
just because you were
His Majesty's lecturer.

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:19.033
Even so, you should not have
acted out alone

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:21.661
like that.

00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:27.041
I thought and believed

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.961
that there would be no better opportunity.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.674
I apologize, Your Highness.

00:35:34.757 --> 00:35:38.010
You provoked His Majesty,
who had been calm since the purge.

00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:40.263
The day you are discovered, all of us…

00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:43.850
will have to pay the price.

00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:50.731
This is a deed to some land in Yeoju.

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:53.776
You should be able to support your family
for the rest of your life.

00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:59.323
Grand Prince Jesan
found out that I was behind

00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:01.242
the attack in Salgoji Forest.

00:36:03.035 --> 00:36:06.956
You have to live like the dead
from now on.

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:45.953
Get him!

00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:06.974
So Grand Prince Jesan
was the one behind Kim Yang-son?

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:09.977
How interesting.

00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:14.815
The foul stench spreads wide.

00:37:20.988 --> 00:37:22.907
You lost him yet again?

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.869
I apologize, Your Highness.

00:37:26.953 --> 00:37:28.704
He must be no ordinary guy.

00:37:29.956 --> 00:37:31.165
That little rat.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.877
I will kill him at all costs
and eliminate all future threats.

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:57.066
You have lost him already…

00:37:59.151 --> 00:38:01.612
and you will never be able to
find him again.

00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:02.697
However,

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.532
he tried to assassinate His Majesty.

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:06.742
He will surely show himself again.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.252
If you make a mistake again,

00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:18.879
it will be your head
that will get cut off.

00:38:21.007 --> 00:38:22.216
I will remember that, Your Highness.

00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:28.347
{\an8}His Majesty has started to eat

00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:31.392
{\an8}the meals prepared by the chief royal cook
since last night?

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:32.518
Yes, Your Grace.

00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:35.021
I heard it from one of the maids
at His Majesty's quarters.

00:38:35.104 --> 00:38:38.024
Send word
to the royal kitchen immediately.

00:38:38.107 --> 00:38:39.775
For His Majesty, a gourmet,

00:38:39.859 --> 00:38:43.946
I will prepare the natgeotsang
after the physical examination today.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.489
Yes, Your Grace.

00:38:46.365 --> 00:38:48.492
Deliver this to Cook Maeng.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.703
Yes, Your Grace.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:55.541
I will not sit back
and let the chief royal cook be this time.

00:38:55.624 --> 00:38:58.961
I will show her myself

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.507
that one can burn
if they approach the sun recklessly.

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:08.179
Here it comes.

00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:09.347
- Here it is.
- Eunuch Yoon.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:10.598
Greetings.

00:39:11.098 --> 00:39:12.183
- My gosh.
- Here.

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.518
- It is beef.
- Beef?

00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:17.146
{\an8}I got the best from Banchon Village.

00:39:18.064 --> 00:39:20.107
My word. Look at this precious thing!

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.234
It must've been freshly butchered.

00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:24.695
It has a nice sheen and lovely marbling.

00:39:25.321 --> 00:39:26.739
It's really fresh.

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:29.992
It sure is.

00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:33.454
I can smell the distinct,
rich aroma of fresh meat.

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.374
We have meat in Saongwon too.

00:39:36.457 --> 00:39:38.167
Why did you go all the way
to Banchon Village?

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.961
Today is the day
of His Majesty's physical examination,

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:43.047
so Grand Prince Jesan
will visit the palace.

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:46.592
Use this to prepare
a special royal meal for them.

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:50.388
What exactly is a physical examination?

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.181
It is a day when Grand Prince Jesan,

00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:54.183
the Superintendent of Saongwon,
visits the palace

00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:59.021
to examine His Majesty's health in detail
with the royal physician.

00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:00.773
Oh, it's like a checkup.

00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:02.608
A checkup?

00:40:03.442 --> 00:40:05.444
Well, I guess you could call it that.

00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:07.738
Then will His Majesty

00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:10.032
and Grand Prince Jesan
dine together today?

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:10.950
Yes.

00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:14.245
Prepare the natgeotsang
so they can dine together.

00:40:14.328 --> 00:40:15.496
Okay, understood.

00:40:16.038 --> 00:40:18.290
- Goodbye.
- All right.

00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:19.458
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:40:21.043 --> 00:40:24.338
So who is this Grand Prince Jesan?

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:27.758
I believe he is the cousin
of His Majesty's father,

00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.427
the late king.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.679
Oh, he's a member of the royal family.

00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:34.014
Wait.

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.724
Grand Prince Jesan?

00:40:35.808 --> 00:40:39.603
Doesn't Grand Prince Jinmyeong
take the throne after a revolt?

00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:41.939
I'm all confused now.

00:40:42.857 --> 00:40:45.734
Since we're expecting a special guest,

00:40:45.818 --> 00:40:46.777
the menu…

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.489
How about we have a meeting
to discuss the food?

00:40:50.573 --> 00:40:51.740
- A meeting?
- Yes.

00:40:51.824 --> 00:40:55.744
- I mean--
- Let us hurry up and gather round.

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:57.705
A meeting?

00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.417
My goodness.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.710
Cook Maeng.

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.966
Yes, my lady. What brings you here?

00:41:10.718 --> 00:41:14.138
Her Grace will serve
the natgeotsang herself today.

00:41:14.221 --> 00:41:16.682
You are to prepare what is written here.

00:41:16.765 --> 00:41:18.893
Her Grace will serve it herself?

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:21.395
- But we have a chief royal--
- Do not talk back.

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.022
Very well. I understand.

00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:34.450
BAEKMAJATANG, HWANGJAGYE HONDONTANG

00:41:36.952 --> 00:41:38.245
They are both made with hens.

00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:42.500
Can you make this side a little rounder?

00:41:42.583 --> 00:41:43.834
Like this?

00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:46.212
I think that's good.

00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:48.964
All right.

00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:53.302
We're expecting a special guest today,
so I'd like to prepare something special.

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:55.804
Where's Cook Maeng?

00:41:55.888 --> 00:41:57.139
Oh, well…

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.141
Here I am.

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:05.981
Her Grace Consort Kang
will serve today's natgeotsang.

00:42:06.065 --> 00:42:08.192
What are you talking about?

00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:09.735
I received an order to prepare the meal

00:42:09.818 --> 00:42:13.697
for His Majesty and Grand Prince Jesan
to have after the physical examination.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.950
Did you?

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:18.327
Well, this is uncalled for.

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:22.206
Does that mean
you will be in charge of cooking?

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:24.124
Yes. I apologize.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:28.712
Why would you apologize?
We have no say in these matters.

00:42:30.756 --> 00:42:33.801
You can do as she said then.

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:36.887
However, I didn't receive
His Majesty's order saying otherwise,

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:39.473
so I'll prepare my natgeotsang as planned.

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:41.642
Yes, she is right.

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:44.061
If we do not prepare anything

00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:47.189
and His Majesty says,
"I did not command such a thing,"

00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:50.276
we will be the ones to lose our lives.

00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:52.278
I understand.

00:42:52.361 --> 00:42:55.155
Cook Min, I need you to assist me.

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:57.074
Yes, I will.

00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.122
All right then.

00:43:03.205 --> 00:43:04.957
Shall I explain the food?

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.625
- Gil-geum?
- Yes.

00:43:09.295 --> 00:43:11.213
Today's dish is…

00:43:12.506 --> 00:43:13.716
{\an8}schnitzel.

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:15.843
{\an8}What? What did you say?

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.261
{\an8}Schni…

00:43:18.137 --> 00:43:19.221
In other words,

00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:22.182
it's a favorite of Koreans,
regardless of their age or gender.

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.768
- Pork cutlet.
- "Cutlet"?

00:43:24.852 --> 00:43:26.562
I have never heard of it before.

00:43:29.064 --> 00:43:30.983
Pound it to spread it thin.

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:32.401
- And cut through the connective tissue.
- Okay.

00:43:34.486 --> 00:43:35.529
That's it. Good.

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:38.532
Cut it this long
and then cut it into quarters.

00:43:39.992 --> 00:43:40.868
Good.

00:43:42.369 --> 00:43:44.246
This is harder than I thought.

00:44:00.262 --> 00:44:02.056
Take the meat that you flattened,

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.558
season it with salt and pepper,

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.435
cover both sides with flour,

00:44:06.518 --> 00:44:08.479
and coat it with beaten eggs.

00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:10.314
Since we don't have breadcrumbs,

00:44:10.397 --> 00:44:13.525
we'll use snowflakes
made with fried loose batter.

00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:15.235
Press it down hard so it sticks.

00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:18.572
Fry that in oil, and it's game over.

00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.286
This is what we call

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.704
schnitzel.

00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:26.914
- Shay…
- Schnitzel.

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:29.166
- Shay…
- No, "sch."

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.712
We'll deep-fry burdock to serve as a side

00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:36.006
and make a sauce with raspberry jam.

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.110
- Do you know this famous saying?
- What is it?

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.821
"Even a shoe tastes good when it's fried."

00:44:58.904 --> 00:45:01.573
"Even a shoe tastes good when it's fried."

00:45:01.657 --> 00:45:03.575
This is amazing, miss.

00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:04.993
Good.

00:45:05.077 --> 00:45:06.912
It's not ready yet.

00:45:08.414 --> 00:45:10.124
- You have to cut it up before eating.
- Oh dear.

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:12.459
You are going to put a knife on the table?

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:15.671
However small it may be,
a knife on His Majesty's table

00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:17.965
means every one of us loses our heads.

00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:20.175
I do not think we should, miss.

00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:21.802
The knife is threatening, huh?

00:45:22.761 --> 00:45:24.471
Then we'll do the cutting beforehand.

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:27.057
You use such strange words.

00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:28.642
What was it? "Cut tea"?

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.436
"Cotty"?

00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:31.937
She said "cotton."

00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:44.825
That looks good.

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:46.660
Her Grace Consort Kang has arrived.

00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:49.663
Oh goodness.

00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:56.753
Is it done?

00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:59.339
Yes, Your Grace. The tables are set.

00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:16.732
That will do. Well done.

00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:26.033
How dare you look at Her Grace like that?

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.243
Pardon?

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.039
- I didn't look at her.
- You dare talk back to me?

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.540
Talk back?

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.292
No. What I meant was--

00:46:35.375 --> 00:46:36.293
Enough.

00:46:37.419 --> 00:46:40.923
It is only natural that one cannot
take their eyes off something beautiful.

00:46:52.017 --> 00:46:53.685
This place is so crowded and messy.

00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:56.522
I will prepare a change of clothes,
Your Grace.

00:46:56.605 --> 00:46:58.440
Let us stop by Jahongwon on the way.

00:46:58.524 --> 00:47:00.442
- Hurry.
- Yes, Your Grace.

00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:07.324
Oh my god.

00:47:08.575 --> 00:47:10.619
Damn her.

00:47:10.702 --> 00:47:12.329
It was plated so perfectly.

00:47:12.412 --> 00:47:14.456
- Let's hurry and plate it again.
- Yes, miss.

00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:25.217
So, how is His Majesty's condition?

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.513
I examined if his stomach
had weakened from fasting,

00:47:30.722 --> 00:47:32.474
but he is in good health.

00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:34.643
However, to prevent upsetting his stomach,

00:47:34.726 --> 00:47:38.480
he should refrain from having cold food
for a while.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.026
What if he were to take
bellflower root extract

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.112
or braised black beans after a meal?

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:47.322
That would be an excellent choice.

00:47:48.782 --> 00:47:51.285
What do you think, Your Majesty?

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:55.372
You never visit the royal kitchen, Uncle,

00:47:56.456 --> 00:47:59.376
yet you only show concern for my health
at my monthly examination.

00:48:02.004 --> 00:48:04.381
{\an8}As the Superintendent of Saongwon,

00:48:04.464 --> 00:48:07.634
{\an8}it is my duty to monitor your health,
Your Majesty.

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.970
You only flaunt your title
at times like this.

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:13.348
I will make sure
to inform those in the royal kitchen.

00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:33.118
What are you waiting for?
Announce Her Grace's arrival.

00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:36.371
Your Majesty.

00:48:36.455 --> 00:48:38.749
- Your natgeotsang is ready.
- Bring it in.

00:49:12.824 --> 00:49:15.202
Your Majesty,
I hope you have been in good health.

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:17.829
Your Highness,
it has been a while since we last met.

00:49:22.584 --> 00:49:24.753
Consort Kang, what is all this?

00:49:24.836 --> 00:49:27.130
I heard about your physical examination
taking place this afternoon

00:49:27.214 --> 00:49:30.300
and hurriedly prepared your natgeotsang.

00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:32.928
Did you make all this?

00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:37.349
I prepared something special
for both you and His Highness

00:49:37.432 --> 00:49:39.017
with the assistance of Cook Maeng.

00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:41.645
The other natgeotsang

00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:45.440
was prepared by the chief royal cook
and the other cooks at the royal kitchen.

00:49:45.524 --> 00:49:47.025
Should you not have informed

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:49.444
the royal kitchen
so you could serve just one dish?

00:49:49.528 --> 00:49:52.280
I knew you'd get told off.

00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:53.740
In your face.

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:56.076
That is what I clearly
instructed them to do,

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:58.286
but when I arrived at the royal kitchen,

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.372
the chief royal cook's dish
was already prepared.

00:50:00.455 --> 00:50:01.915
She must have thought

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:05.836
my food would not be good enough.

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:09.381
What's this childish move?

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:18.598
She probably prepared a meal
because I did not give a direct order.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.563
Then you should enjoy
your usual natgeotsang

00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:28.692
and consider my humble dish
a modest token of my sincerity.

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.235
I shall.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:36.533
Your Majesty, it is truly admirable
how much Her Grace cares for you.

00:50:37.909 --> 00:50:40.287
Are you the chief royal cook?

00:50:41.246 --> 00:50:44.374
Yes. She is the newly appointed
chief royal cook at the royal kitchen.

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:48.295
You must be the Cook Yeon
I heard many rumors about.

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:49.504
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:50:49.588 --> 00:50:53.967
I heard of your visit,
so I prepared something special.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.719
I hope it's to your taste.

00:50:56.678 --> 00:50:57.763
I look forward to it.

00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:01.767
She is a great beauty

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.769
and speaks without fear.

00:51:07.147 --> 00:51:08.106
Taste the food.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.399
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:24.581
Is this chogyetang, cold chicken soup?

00:51:24.664 --> 00:51:25.707
{\an8}It is baekmajatang.

00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:28.668
{\an8}It is a cold chicken soup
made with a broth prepared by simmering

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:31.588
{\an8}a young hen for an extended time,
then finished with shredded chicken

00:51:31.671 --> 00:51:33.048
{\an8}and ground sesame seeds.

00:51:33.131 --> 00:51:36.593
It invigorates the organs
and helps fight the summer heat,

00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:37.886
so it is almost medicinal.

00:51:37.969 --> 00:51:40.555
I prepared it especially for you,
Your Majesty.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.809
I was told to avoid cold foods.

00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:53.568
What is this dish, Your Grace?

00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:58.490
That is called hwangjagye hondontang.

00:51:58.573 --> 00:52:00.867
{\an8}The bones of a yellow-feathered hen
called hwangjagye

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.327
were boiled for a long time.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.496
{\an8}A characteristic of the dish

00:52:04.579 --> 00:52:07.582
{\an8}is the seasoned chicken filling
wrapped like dumplings and boiled.

00:52:07.666 --> 00:52:09.835
I prepared a soothing meal for you,
Your Highness,

00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:12.045
as you are quite the drinker.

00:52:12.754 --> 00:52:15.340
It smells delicious.

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:35.235
Both dishes are made with only hen meat.

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.194
That is correct.

00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:38.280
All things female may look different
on the outside,

00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:39.781
but they are the same on the inside.

00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:44.119
I prepared the dishes,
hoping you would consider them a lesson

00:52:44.202 --> 00:52:48.665
that teaches you to stay away from women
and focus on your duties as a king.

00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:53.253
Wait. Is she saying I'm a hen?

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.630
How ridiculous.

00:52:55.714 --> 00:52:58.341
That is truly commendable.

00:52:58.925 --> 00:53:00.427
I will keep that in mind.

00:53:02.137 --> 00:53:04.180
What is the dish

00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:06.558
that you specially prepared for us,
Chief Royal Cook?

00:53:06.641 --> 00:53:08.643
What did you make today?

00:53:10.061 --> 00:53:11.855
The dish I prepared today

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:14.357
is a German dish called schnitzel.

00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:17.360
"Shiny shell"?

00:53:21.489 --> 00:53:22.657
My goodness.

00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:25.911
That is not it, Your Majesty.

00:53:25.994 --> 00:53:27.329
{\an8}It is sunchae.

00:53:27.412 --> 00:53:30.165
{\an8}You might not know what it is,

00:53:30.248 --> 00:53:33.835
{\an8}but sunchae is an edible vegetable
very similar to lotus leaf.

00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:35.295
Sunchae.

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:37.047
- Oh, sunchae?
- Yes.

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.966
What…

00:53:47.098 --> 00:53:50.477
What did you say this was called again?

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.062
{\an8}Beef schnitzel.

00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:53.855
{\an8}"Buffed shell"?

00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:55.065
{\an8}BEEF SCHNITZEL
GERMAN HOMESTYLE BEEF CUTLET

00:53:56.524 --> 00:53:59.945
Uncle, you said it was sunchae.

00:54:01.446 --> 00:54:05.116
To make schnitzel,
you thinly pound a slice of meat,

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.495
then coat it in breadcrumbs
and fry it in oil.

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:11.915
Dipping it in the sweet and sour fruit jam
is what makes this dish a banger--

00:54:13.625 --> 00:54:14.668
I mean,
that's a characteristic of the dish.

00:54:15.835 --> 00:54:19.714
It's full of protein, which aids
the recovery of your body and mind.

00:54:19.798 --> 00:54:22.384
As Your Majesty skipped meals for a while,

00:54:22.467 --> 00:54:27.555
I prepared something especially tasty
and nutritious with fresh beef.

00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:32.686
Yet another strange dish.

00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:35.146
But it will not go your way today.

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.857
- Taste it.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:54:56.584 --> 00:54:59.879
It looks as if our native blackberry
has bloomed on top of a buchimgae.

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.673
It is truly a work of art.

00:55:03.174 --> 00:55:06.970
The white thing on top. Is that milk?

00:55:07.053 --> 00:55:08.888
That's tartar sauce.

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.975
It's creamy, but also sweet and sour.

00:55:12.726 --> 00:55:14.394
If you want to eat it sweeter,

00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:17.063
you can dip the meat
in the raspberry jam on the side.

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:20.859
Gleamy taro and dip in jam?

00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:23.445
Oh, raspberry…

00:55:23.528 --> 00:55:25.196
Blackberry jammy.

00:55:26.614 --> 00:55:28.199
Blackberry jammy.

00:55:28.283 --> 00:55:30.035
You can dip it like this.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.328
Dip and eat.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:34.414
Dip and eat?

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:36.708
Stick it in deep. Dip and eat.

00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:39.169
Do you mean like this?

00:55:39.252 --> 00:55:40.336
Yes, like that.

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:11.409
How can this be?

00:56:12.494 --> 00:56:13.620
What is this taste?

00:56:21.127 --> 00:56:25.048
It is crunchy on the outside,
but moist and chewy on the inside.

00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:27.717
Your Majesty, that's what we call

00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:30.512
"crunchy out, chewy in."

00:56:30.595 --> 00:56:32.764
"Crunchy out, chewy in"?

00:56:34.474 --> 00:56:36.392
I know what that means.

00:56:36.476 --> 00:56:40.855
Does it not mean crunchy on the outside
and chewy on the inside?

00:56:41.523 --> 00:56:42.440
Yes.

00:56:42.524 --> 00:56:44.025
It's a short way of saying

00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:47.737
it's crunchy on the outside
and chewy on the inside.

00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:49.280
Crunchy out, chewy in.

00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:51.241
You shorten all sorts of things.
How unnecessary.

00:56:52.534 --> 00:56:54.577
Yes, it's called SAS, Shorten All Sorts.

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:57.539
Why is she picking on me for no reason?

00:56:57.622 --> 00:57:00.083
Hey, Mok-ju. I can bite back if I want to.

00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:10.009
Your Majesty.

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.302
Your Highness.

00:57:11.803 --> 00:57:14.264
Why don't you try the vegetables
on the side?

00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.224
Do you mean this?

00:57:16.307 --> 00:57:18.560
Yes. That's burdock.

00:57:18.643 --> 00:57:21.187
It'll cut through
the greasiness of the meat.

00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:25.316
It is bitter.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.444
Uncle is right. It is bitter.

00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:32.407
People tend to eat
the leaves and stems of vegetables

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:35.160
and throw out the roots
because they're bitter.

00:57:35.243 --> 00:57:36.119
But the truth is,

00:57:36.202 --> 00:57:38.413
the roots contain more nutrients.

00:57:38.496 --> 00:57:42.208
It worries me that you might
misjudge someone

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.544
based on their appearance

00:57:45.503 --> 00:57:46.838
without considering their roots.

00:57:50.425 --> 00:57:51.968
How dare you, you wench?

00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:00.560
It is bitter,

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.145
but as you said,

00:58:02.228 --> 00:58:05.064
it did cleanse my palate.

00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:09.319
I will always remember
the roots of the vegetable.

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.404
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:58:12.197 --> 00:58:15.283
Shall we enjoy the food then?

00:58:15.366 --> 00:58:16.284
Yes, Uncle.

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.620
- Please enjoy.
- I will.

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:39.474
All right.

00:58:47.732 --> 00:58:48.566
Gosh, it's bitter.

00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.083
I will never,

00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:08.253
ever let you get away with this.

00:59:08.336 --> 00:59:09.587
You're ticked off, aren't you?

00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:11.339
So don't cross the line.

00:59:11.923 --> 00:59:14.050
You might be the most villainous woman
of your time,

00:59:14.133 --> 00:59:15.843
but I'm from the future.

00:59:15.927 --> 00:59:17.804
I know more than you do.

00:59:22.684 --> 00:59:24.394
That was delicious.

00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:34.362
Watching you enjoy your meal
also put me in a good mood, Your Majesty.

00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:39.826
Your Majesty,
I believe Her Grace and Cook Yeon

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.744
should be rewarded greatly.

00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:46.124
Your Grace,
is there anything you wish for?

00:59:46.207 --> 00:59:49.961
All I wish for
is His Majesty's health and safety.

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:55.300
You are truly virtuous and wise.

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:58.094
Thank you, Consort Kang.

00:59:58.803 --> 01:00:01.973
Cook Yeon, is there anything you wish for?

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:03.182
What I wish for?

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:05.059
My…

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:08.813
I can't mention my handbag
in front of her.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.774
Well…

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.443
Your Majesty.

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:15.862
Women, by nature,
are easily swayed by gifts.

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.155
What is most important

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:19.324
is that you find out what she likes
and give her that.

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:23.703
Tell me. What is it that you want?

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:26.956
Well, actually…

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.339
I get excited and happy
when I see fresh, new ingredients.

01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:37.675
All that is at Saongwon, so I'm fine.

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.052
I appreciate the thought though.

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.972
All you want are some vegetables?

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.557
As expected of a chief royal cook.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.686
She seems to want something very big.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.441
You're the one who wants something big.

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:56.778
Is that so?

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:58.154
No, Your Majesty.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:01:01.449
- Really, I don't want anything.
- As the Superintendent of Saongwon,

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:05.078
I will send you all the vegetables,
whether big or small.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.950
BEEF

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.494
People tend to eat

01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:48.329
the leaves and stems of vegetables

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:51.290
and throw out the roots
because they're bitter.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.419
But the truth is,
the roots contain more nutrients.

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:58.464
No matter the situation,
she is cheerful and wise.

01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:02.093
Your Majesty! The theme
of the competition was filial piety.

01:02:02.176 --> 01:02:03.886
Wouldn't it be unfilial

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.930
to cut off the arms of such cooks?

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.809
She was benevolent enough
to save the lives

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:10.935
of her competitors.

01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:17.900
She is a wise

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:19.485
and thoughtful woman.

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:23.740
TARTAR SAUCE, FRIED BURDOCK, RASPBERRY JAM

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:27.326
{\an8}CRUNCHY OUT, CHEWY IN

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.455
{\an8}The envoys will arrive soon,

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:33.332
so why are there so many complaints?

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.709
You should rest for a short while.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.794
I will read the rest.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:39.088
You are the most filial son.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.301
- Oh gosh, that hurt.
- Goodness me.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:45.428
So tell me, son.

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:48.681
Is His Majesty making progress
with the chief royal cook?

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:52.643
I am asking if the new playground
you set up for him is working.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:53.644
Father.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:54.896
His Majesty has reached the point

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:57.982
where he is contemplating
what gift to give her.

01:02:58.065 --> 01:03:01.152
If he is contemplating
what gift to give a woman,

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:03.237
it means he is besotted with her.

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.823
Since that is your specialty,

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:09.660
be sure to tell His Majesty
the ideal gift to give her.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:11.996
You want me to prepare Cook Yeon's gift…

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:18.419
Did something come to mind?

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:21.380
There is one thing the gwinyeo
is desperately looking for.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:22.340
What is that?

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:24.926
When we brought her here
from the Gyeonggi Governor's Office,

01:03:25.009 --> 01:03:27.845
she lost her bundle in Salgoji Forest.

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:30.640
- I found it and kept it.
- A bundle?

01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:34.143
Was there something important inside?

01:03:34.727 --> 01:03:36.270
She was so desperate to find it,

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.606
so I thought maybe
there was some gold inside.

01:03:40.107 --> 01:03:41.484
My goodness.

01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:46.364
"Republic of Korea, passport."

01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:48.699
"Republic of Korea."

01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:51.786
Republic of Korea.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.167
The gwinyeo!

01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:01.045
It was full of strange items.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:06.342
Then it should be fine
returning it to her.

01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:10.555
At any rate, if it is something
the gwinyeo is desperately looking for,

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:13.307
you should give it to His Majesty.

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:16.519
I shall. Having you point things out

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:19.021
is certainly helping my mind
become sharp and clear again.

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:26.153
If His Majesty returns
the handybag to Cook Yeon…

01:04:28.322 --> 01:04:29.991
That will bring them closer.

01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:31.576
"Handybag"?

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:37.456
{\an8}BONGDEOKGUNG

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.374
{\an8}"Handybag"?

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:39.792
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:42.587
It is what Cook Yeon
is desperately looking for.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.178
It is what she was looking for
when she claimed to be from the future.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.388
It is, Your Majesty.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.727
How did this come into your possession?

01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:00.813
The day after you threw it over the cliff,

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.232
I sent someone to retrieve it.

01:05:04.775 --> 01:05:08.195
I am certain Cook Yeon will appreciate it
if you give this to her.

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.281
You are quite silly.

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:18.664
But how did you know I had been
contemplating a gift for Cook Yeon?

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:25.421
One glance and I know.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:29.383
Thank you.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.094
By the way, Your Majesty,

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.013
about the Ming envoys we are expecting.

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.056
What about them?

01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:36.641
Chief Envoy Yu Kun

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.851
is said to have brought
as many as three first-class cooks.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.144
That many?

01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:44.315
Has word of my picky taste
reached that far?

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:47.360
It seems they are planning on
captivating you

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:49.403
to get something out of you.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:50.863
They want something?

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.115
I do not know for sure what that is yet,

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:55.868
but he represents the imperial Ming,
so the demand must be quite substantial.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:59.080
Something that could be hard for us

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:00.998
to either accept or refuse.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:05.378
Three first-class cooks
and a considerable demand?

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.967
{\an8}BYEOKJEGWAN

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.102
Ask if the food is not to his liking.

01:06:31.737 --> 01:06:34.573
He does not wish to eat it.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:35.908
What?

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:40.037
YU KUN
THE MING'S CHIEF ENVOY

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:48.212
TANG BAILONG
MASTER OF SICHUAN CUISINE

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:49.273
Please try it.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.529
What is this?

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:05.539
He says not to be surprised.

01:08:05.623 --> 01:08:08.709
The tofu was sliced as thin as a thread
and made to look like a blossoming flower.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.559
This is what we eat in our great country.

01:08:26.143 --> 01:08:28.687
Go and tell your king

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:33.025
that I cannot eat Joseon food.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.659
I didn't know there was a place like this.

01:08:42.409 --> 01:08:43.869
{\an8}This is Jangwonseo,
Office of Royal Horticulture.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:47.998
{\an8}JANGWONSEO: OFFICE IN CHARGE OF GROWING
PLANTS AND FRUITS IN THE ROYAL GARDENS

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:52.044
This is where we grow the flowers, fruits,
and vegetables we serve the royals.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.631
Take a look.

01:09:00.594 --> 01:09:02.930
Oh, Jangwonseo.

01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:04.807
I read about it in history books.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.725
The world's first greenhouse.

01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:09.937
I don't believe this.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.195
An apple tree.

01:09:20.614 --> 01:09:22.741
A mandarin tree too.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.869
This is amazing.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:29.999
They smell amazing too.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:32.877
Right?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.044
Come here.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.059
Why are you making a fuss over nothing?

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:51.604
It's because
I've never seen anything like it.

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.648
You may feel free to use this place.

01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:56.066
Pardon?

01:09:57.776 --> 01:09:59.445
You need fresh ingredients

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.822
to cook more delicious food.

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:05.034
Is this like a free pass?

01:10:05.117 --> 01:10:08.621
Well, I guess you could say so.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:12.958
It is a gift.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:15.669
A gift?

01:10:16.462 --> 01:10:17.463
Yes.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.590
Take a look around.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.517
This is a pyeondo tree.

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:32.853
It yields wonky peaches.

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:35.105
It was a tribute
offered by a Persian merchant,

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.315
but the fruit is inedible.

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:38.150
It is ornamental.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:42.154
Your Majesty, this is edible.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:46.325
It is unbearably astringent.

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.035
The fruit, yes.

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:49.870
The seeds are the good part.

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:53.749
Where I'm from, we call the seeds

01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:55.334
almonds.

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.211
"All mend"?

01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:02.341
Come this way.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.890
This is where poisonous plants
are studied.

01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:12.184
Do not go too close.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:19.191
POISON

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.444
I told you they were poisonous!

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:23.946
Do not touch them.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:25.197
Your Majesty.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:28.617
These are gochu, chili peppers!

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:29.910
Gocho?

01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:32.079
I can make gochugaru now.

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.082
Do not…

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:39.295
Where did you get these?

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:43.048
A few years ago,
we saved a shipwrecked westerner,

01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.301
and they gave this to us
as a token of gratitude.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:47.678
However, they were too spicy and potent

01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:49.430
that some even died eating them.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.558
They are grown here to use as poison.

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.393
I heard they used this as a weapon
a long time ago.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.894
So it was really true.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.438
This is amazing.

01:11:57.521 --> 01:12:01.859
Your Majesty, this is a huge windfall!

01:12:01.942 --> 01:12:02.985
A windfall?

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:05.571
Are you that pleased?

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:06.989
Totally!

01:12:07.072 --> 01:12:08.490
My goodness.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:09.533
Then,

01:12:10.784 --> 01:12:11.660
what about this?

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.163
What's this?

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.250
I found it on the way here.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.543
What?

01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:21.754
What is it?

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.757
It is what you have been
desperately looking for.

01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:27.092
The handybag.

01:12:28.635 --> 01:12:31.013
What? No way.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.307
Is it really?

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.146
Thank you!

01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:41.565
Thank you so much!

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:44.610
How did you find it?

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.029
I told you

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:48.989
I found it on the way here.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.076
I'm…

01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:55.704
I'm so happy that I can't believe it.

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.209
It is nothing at all.

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:01.543
What do you mean it's nothing?

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.712
This means so much to me.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:09.176
Are you no longer angry then?

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:12.679
About what happened at Unyeongjeong…

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.642
I am sorry.

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:22.106
Are you apologizing to me?

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.193
Then was this gift

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.862
to make me feel better?

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:30.322
Yes.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:31.740
That is right.

01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:34.201
Why?

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:36.703
Why, you ask?

01:13:57.307 --> 01:13:58.308
It is because…

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.978
Is he…

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.815
I have begun to see you as a woman.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.449
It is because I am pleased with the food
you prepare for me.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.159
What?

01:14:16.577 --> 01:14:20.372
Why did you turn away from me to say that?

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.127
Because I…

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.379
Why are you walking away from me?

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:28.797
- Because I…
- Why…

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:18.138
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.432
{\an8}I'm going to go back now.

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:24.394
{\an8}Just where does she keep saying
she will go?

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.983
{\an8}The taste of true Joseon food.

01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:31.235
{\an8}No!

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:34.947
{\an8}You can't suddenly tell me to bear
the weight of the country's future.

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.406
{\an8}If you want to return,

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.658
{\an8}win.

01:15:37.741 --> 01:15:39.993
{\an8}Joseon must lose this competition.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:41.828
{\an8}They are no ordinary cooks.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:43.789
{\an8}- Tell him
- Let's win, royal kitchen!

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:45.791
{\an8}that I also have
a special chief royal cook.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.418
{\an8}I'll give you a blazing hot taste.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:55.425
