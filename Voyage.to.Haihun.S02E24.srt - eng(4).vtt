00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.690
Yes, someone is robbing a tomb.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530
It's the place I just mentioned.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.670
Officer, please come quickly.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.390
Who are you talking to?

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.990
The police.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710
So this is the police?

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.690
No, it's a mobile phone.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.360
It's the latest model.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.500
My mom bought it for me.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.610
If she hadn't sent it to me,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.720
I'd still have no idea where she is.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.390
Has it been long since you saw her?

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.610
Ever since she divorced my father,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.300
I haven't seen her again.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.450
Devour soul?

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.770
Such a sinister art truly exists.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.020
When I was very young,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.930
both my parents passed away.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.450
So for me,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.020
seeing them is impossible.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.860
Didn't expect you to be so pitiful.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.170
But I have a lot of buddies.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.420
One of them is truly unusual.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.820
How unusual?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.540
Is he amazing?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.260
He always comes up with

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.960
all sorts of strange, wild ideas.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.930
He's helped me solve many problems.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.220
And he's skilled at parkour.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.830
What's parkour?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.610
Sounds cool just from the name.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.760
Jumping up and down all over the place,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.120
like running across rooftops.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.050
Oh, that I know well.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.870
I do it every day in the school.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.440
Isn't it just climbing walls?

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.100
That's one way to put it.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.590
Then train hard.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.170
You'll need it someday.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.170
Mm.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.620
Interesting.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.140
My house

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.800
is several times taller
than the highest building here.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.460
At night, the whole city
glows with lights.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.650
So bright you can't see the stars.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.790
The carriages need no horses.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.440
They move on their own.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.420
My wish

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.930
has finally come true.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.890
This is for you.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.260
What is it?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.720
Bronze Qilin.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.260
Half for you, half for me.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.580
Consider it a token of our brotherhood.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.500
Who said I'm your buddy?

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.200
We've been talking for a while.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.750
There's at least a bit of bond.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.170
I hold my buddies to high standards.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.440
It's not a bit of.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.700
It's the tiniest bit.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.710
I'm only giving you this as a buddy.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.020
Think of it as a charm for protection.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.920
There's also a spell to keep you safe.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.170
Really?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.090
Mm.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.610
Bronze Qilin,

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.150
guard the universe.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.950
The firmament shines,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.410
granting my wish.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.400
Changes are cyclical,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.980
eternal as sun and moon.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.940
Unveil the mysteries,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.050
all at my command.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.050
Got it memorized?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.800
Mm.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.810
Really?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.370
Who are you looking down on?

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.010
I've got a great memory.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.420
It's all because of you.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.510
Chatting with you

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.570
made me miss my stop.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.050
Sir,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.300
I need to get off.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.810
Remember our promise.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.560
What promise?

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.630
The authority received a report,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.540
(Nanchang, Jiangxi)
saying someone engaged

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.680
(Police)
in grave robbing.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.470
The police acted swiftly,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.050
working with the archaeology team.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.100
They headed to the site for investigation.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.860
After the initial survey,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.520
it was confirmed to be
a grand Han Dynasty tomb.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.980
Some experts suggested

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.130
the owner might be Liu He,
the first Haihun Marquis.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.490
You're awake.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.210
Don't move.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.590

Twenty-seven days?

Twenty-seven...

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720
What are you looking for?

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.140
Is this what you're after?
