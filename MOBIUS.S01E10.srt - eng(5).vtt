half a minute before the fire started,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.820

No trace of his body was ever found.

That extra person was Jiang Yuwen.

He even prepared a firefighter uniform.

This was all part of his plan.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.100
went in before the fire started.

He couldn't have escaped without burns.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.590
there was a hiding place.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800
You're a big help.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.350
Alright.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.580
Everyone's here.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.200
Let's begin.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:24.850
Qi.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.640
This is what you asked for.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.370
I even called in

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.320
my Interpol contacts for this.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:35.930
Tell me.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:36.810
What does Maggie

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.610
have to do with the Squid's case?

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.210
It doesn't make sense
for her to invest in Moma now.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.490
So you understand investments too?

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.420
Two out of three executives are dead.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.350
Would you invest in such a company?

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.830
Indeed. The feng shui is terrible.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.570
Maggie

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.350
was born and raised in America,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.490
comes from a single-parent family,
and graduated from a top university.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.950
She's also a math prodigy.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.900
After graduation,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.050
she joined Volly, the world's
most prestigious investment firm—

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.770
the one you mentioned.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:04.910
From then on,

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.950
everything went smoothly for her.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:07.610
And

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.490
her mother

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.330
is even more interesting.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.660
She's just a housewife

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.940
with little education

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.180
and poor English skills.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:14.970
But one year,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.780
she suddenly won the lottery.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.900
Then she began investing in stocks,

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.900
using a snowball strategy,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.830
steadily growing her wealth—

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.560
from poverty to the middle class.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.690
Isn't that amazing?

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:27.650
I'm familiar with this story.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:28.900
What year?

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.900
July 2016.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.850
2016?

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.860
2016 again.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.140
What's wrong with that?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.090
N-Nothing.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.840
What about her father?

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.960
As for her father,

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:43.900
I've looked into that too,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.260
but there's no information at all.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.970
I've also checked

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.090
their social media accounts,

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.750
but they never mentioned him.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:51.400
That's it?

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400
That's all I have.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.140
Thanks.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.270
Is that all the gratitude I get?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.520
At least
let's have tea together next time.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:48.420
Miss Maggie?

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.690
You're the driver
Mr. Mo sent to pick me up?

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.480
Yes, Mr. Mo asked me to pick you up.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.090
Where's the car?

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:54.590
Let's go.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.120
This way.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.020
I got this coffee for you,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.750
Dark roast flat white with ice.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:02.920
Thank you.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.859
Just arrived in Hua'ao,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.060
and now going to Moma.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.440
M-Miss Maggie?

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.580
Is this your first time in Hua'ao?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.900
I came here once a long time ago.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.030
How long will you be staying this time?

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.980
I'm leaving this afternoon.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.230
We need to hurry.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.220
Alright.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.250
She has no memory of the M17 intersection.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:18.860
No.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.360
No.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.170
She has no memory of the accident either.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.430
Her immediate reaction was too genuine.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.730
She's not a time loop perceiver.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.320
Boss,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.490
the shareholders' meeting
turned into a fight.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.020
Someone even broke a glass.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.280
The glass-breaking happened
at the same time.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.430
Mo Yuanzhi's loop

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.610
is back on track.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.050
She's just a housewife

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.450
with little education

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.520
and poor English skills.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.360
But one year,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.210
she suddenly won the lottery.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.010
Then

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.490
she began investing in stocks,

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.530
using a snowball strategy,

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.450
steadily growing her wealth—

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.660
from poverty to the middle class.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.580
A housewife or a child

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.470
who suddenly knows
how to manipulate stocks.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.010
Someone who can change the loop at 12:15.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.820
During Moma's crisis,

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.620
she suddenly decided to invest.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.670
She has a strong interest
in genetic technology.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.300
If Maggie isn't a time loop perceiver,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.690
then behind her,

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.310
there must be someone.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.450
Hello, Maggie.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.620
Welcome to Moma.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.230
Welcome, Maggie.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.130
Nice to meet you.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.260
Nice to meet you too.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.990
How was your trip?

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.090
A bit eventful but fine.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.860
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Mo.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.340
We're honored that Volly

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.820
has chosen to invest in Moma.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.940
Our shareholders and executives

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.000
are all upstairs waiting to meet you.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:40.770
Mr. Mo,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.940
my time is very limited today.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.690
If Volly is to invest in Moma,

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.800
it's because we value your gene-based drug

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.380
and RAN technology.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.420
So I'd rather

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.210
visit the test site first.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.080
Good.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:54.700
This way, please.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.420
Thank you.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.660
Mr. Mo.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.190
Yu Shiya's track has changed.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:00.820
At this moment,

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.420
she should be on the rooftop.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.130
Why did you abstain

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.810
during the shareholder vote?

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.180
Didn't we agree

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.210
that my 20% shares,

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.660
combine with your 15%,

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.900
would give us control of Moma

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.780
as soon as Mo Yuanzhi fell?

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.340
At the most critical moment—

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:27.250
Han Yufei,

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.450
our deal is over.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.420
I don't want

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.180
your shares.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.560
I'll pretend I never saw you today.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.680
Why?

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.580
You

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.010
are no match for him.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.490
Fine.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.800
Our deal can end.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.470
But

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.380
tell me the access code to the lab.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.030
I advise you not to go.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.170
Then it seems I need

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.620
to have a chat with Mr. Mo

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.770
about how his wife

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.770
schemed for his assets.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.840
You know what to do.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.570
Don't come looking for me again!

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.710
Let's talk.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.050
You must also feel
that your father's death

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.180
is very suspicious.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.180
Especially after Squid appeared,

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.100
it became even more certain

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.300
that he was murdered.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.180
I know clearly

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.830
that you're sitting in this office

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.660
not for shares or power,

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:48.860
but to find out

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.450
who killed your father.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.590
We're on the same page about that.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.860
How do you plan to find them?

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.250
There are secrets
hidden in Mo Yuanzhi's laboratory.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:06.140
Some matters

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.110
should be left for the police to handle.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.860
Can I trust you?

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.750
What did you say?

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:37.940
Your secret laboratory?

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.690
What you're doing

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.100
will destroy all of Moma.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.260
[Han Song]

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.430
I drank too much last night.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.990
I didn't mean to upset you.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.620
Don't be mad at me.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.820
Dad,

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.990
I don't want

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.150
to hang out with those people anymore.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.350
I want to learn something useful.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.150
Stop making resolutions.

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.140
You've made too many promises before.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.290
I'm serious this time.

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.220
I've thought it through.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:41.530
I want to join Moma

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.360
and start from the bottom,

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.190
learning step by step.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:45.860
I'll do whatever you want me to.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.390
Why do you want to join Moma?

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.520
I'm trying to get away from it.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.290
Recently, I'm planning

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.730
to sell my shares.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.060
The further away from Moma, the better.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.580
Selling all your shares?

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.940
Are you kidding me?

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.210
Moma is on the rise now.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.900
Its value could multiply dozens of times
in the future.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.530
Yet you want to sell your shares now?

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:06.460
You don't know shit.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.340
It's such a simple concept.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.740
What don't I understand?

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.210
Why are you choosing to pull out now?

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.330
Does it have something to do

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.540
with that secret laboratory?

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.970
What did you say?

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.970
Where did you hear that?

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.900
You were talking very loudly just now.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:41.690
If you don't want to talk about it,

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.090
I won't mention it again.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.230
Listen to me carefully.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.290
Stay out of this mess.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.010
What you just heard

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.380
cannot be shared with anyone.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.440
Do you understand?

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.010
My father told me

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.910
not to tell anyone

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.670
about Mo Yuanzhi's secret lab.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.310
I don't know what's wrong with him.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.110
I've never seen my father so nervous.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.180
Tonight,

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.220
Mo Yuanzhi will attend
the Zhao family's wedding.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.660
This is the best opportunity.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.520
You should listen to your father.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.580
Don't get involved in this mess.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.920
Let me know when you've made up your mind.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.290
I'm quite optimistic

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.450
about this investment.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.310
I'll give you an answer
as soon as possible.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.180
I believe we'll meet again soon.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.770
Safe travels, Maggie.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.610
Thank you.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:04.490
Mr. Mo,

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.100
goodbye.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.280
Everyone, give me a quick update
on your situation.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.070

[Hua'ao]

An Lan hasn't moved.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.910
Maggie has also left the country.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.730
I'm still investigating Jiang Yuwen.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.730
Oh my God.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.620
Boss,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.430
you need to come take a look.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.450
Dr. Chen,

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.290
I'd like to access

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.340
all of my mother's medical records
since her admission.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.580
Medical records

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:45.620
during the past three years
of hospitalization?

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.290
Yes.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.690
I want to study them

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.580
to see
if there's a faster treatment option.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.340
Okay.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.420
I'll ask the Medical Records Department
to prepare them.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.860
You're really anxious.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.210
I've seen many patients' families.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.380
Everyone is anxious,

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.440
but you're the most exceptional one.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:02.490
An Lan,

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.010
let me ask you something.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.340
Be honest with me.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:07.180
Have you been

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.510
secretly giving your mother medication?

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.750
The change in your mother's condition
early this morning

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.100
didn't happen out of nowhere.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.290
Currently in the market,
there's no drug available

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.250
that can produce this effect.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.690
But the fact is,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.620
the effect of such medication

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.340
might only be temporary.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.530
This kind of thing

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.140
has happened before.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:31.600
I advise you

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:32.990
not to take such risks.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.620
Happened before? When?

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.520
I've reviewed almost all related cases,

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.450
both domestic and international.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:40.580
Why haven't I heard

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.580
about the precedent you mentioned?

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.940
It's an informal case
of an anonymous patient.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.910
I've only heard about it.

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:50.290
Seven days

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.100
after recovery,

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.830
the body completely collapsed

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.910
in a hospice.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080
Which hospital?

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.530
I'm not sure either.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.970
At the time, I thought

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.900
this case was way too sketchy—

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.700
definitely just a small clinic.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:05.610
Which year?

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.820
It was many years ago.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.180
Should be 2016, I think.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.200
A patient
with late-stage malignant spinal tumor.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.420
How do you know?

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.820
A hospice...

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:27.100
Dr. Chen,

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.140
may I use your computer for a while?

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.530
Go ahead.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.490
Thank you.

Wanqing,

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.300
did I disturb your sleep?

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:06.900
Not at all.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.050
The only things I do all day
are eating and sleeping.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.250
The happiest part is chatting with you.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:18.820
What's the date today?

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.449
Are you still half asleep?

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:21.449
It's the 5th.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.300
The 5th.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:25.940
The 5th.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.790
What happened to your hand?

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.520
I accidentally bumped into it.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.790
Why have you lost so much weight?

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.420
That's terrible.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.489
Are you not used to the food there?

The caregiver?

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.210
A male caregiver, right?

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.260
I can tell by that look in your eyes.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.530
Of course.

you're getting better and better.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.300
Of course I remember.

I have to give it a shot.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.800
I must take this chance.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.310
I'll have specialists
look at them for you.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.340
Wanqing,

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.520
have you changed
to another hospital recently?

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.710
What's wrong?

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.560
I found two big pieces of news.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.260
Jiang Yuwen once had a daughter.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.460
You won't believe it,

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:37.610
but Jiang Yuwen's wife

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.740
died shortly
after their daughter was born.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:40.820
Jiang Yuwen was focused
entirely on his research

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.700
and had no ability to raise a child.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.530
So he gave the child

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.730
to a couple who couldn't have children.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.420
Both parties kept it very confidential,

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.170
so almost nobody knows about it.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:49.940
But

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.950
I just found the adoption records
from back then.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:53.940
So,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.050
we all know this girl.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:57.490
Tang Xin?

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.010
Tang Xin is Jiang Yuwen's daughter?

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:13.160
In the cake bombing case,

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.340
Tang Xin was indeed
one of the three survivors

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.010
at Moma Group.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.940
If Jiang Yuwen is Squid,

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.700
there's no way he'd want his daughter

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:25.700
to get hurt.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:27.860
But is he really Squid?

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:28.610
Boss.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.060
Boss!

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.380
Um,

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.010
has mass surveillance
located Jiang Yuwen yet?

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.760
Not yet.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.870
We've been continuously expanding
the search area.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.900
How is that possible?

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.530
Didn't you mention two earlier?

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:45.730
What's the other one?

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.450
Jiang Yuwen has another child.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.260
We've only found partial information
from the US.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.380
During his time as a visiting scholar
in America,

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.760
he had a child

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.180
with a local Asian woman.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:58.700
But later,

00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.990
both the child and mother

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.650
disappeared without a trace.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:02.860
Which year?

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.530
He went to America in 1995,

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.570
but we don't know

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:10.340
when the child was born.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.110
1995.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.790
America.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.740
I met Maggie when I was

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.490
an exchange student in America.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:20.820
What about her father?

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.570
I've looked into that too,

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.940
but there's no information at all.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.650
I've also checked

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:25.780
their social media accounts,

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.440
but they never mentioned him.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.010
Come with me.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.110
Take this back

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.540
and give it to Duan Zheng.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.570
Okay.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:06.750
Boss,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.020
I asked Peishan to take a cup back.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.070
I need you to do

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:11.010
a paternity test

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.170
as quickly as possible.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.230
Who are we testing?

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:14.930
Jiang Yuwen.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:39.050
Please do this for me

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.770
as quickly as possible.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:40.210
Okay.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.530
This facial close-up

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.420
needs to be slightly larger

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.420
and sharper.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.010
Officer Ding,

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.740
I heard you were looking for me.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.940
Long hair and short hair, right?

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.090
This can't be the only—

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:53.650
Go ahead.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.570
Let's try a different angle.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:14.090
[DNA Paternity Test Report]

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:16.830
There it is.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:17.610
Thank you.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:22.270
Qi,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.550
Maggie

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.780
is Jiang Yuwen's biological daughter.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.880
Damn it.
