WEBVTT

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.270
Hey, if you're not alone, just listen.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.380
(Episode 64)

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.810
What's going on?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.450
Well, Manager Gong was here saying things
that were really strange.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.250
I'm talking about her boss,
Min Kyung Chae.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.350
She's never been married, right?

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.790
Well, she said Kyung Chae was actually
Se Ri's mother.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.990
What? What did you say?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.090
What in the world is going on?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.360
Running away from home?
Even Se Ri doesn't do that.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.860
Well, there's been a complication.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.000
If something was wrong,
you should have told me first.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.130
Ms. Kyung Chae.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.400
I don't think I can ever go back.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.070
- I'm just calling to say goodbye.
- Manager Gong.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.340
Seriously, what's gotten into you?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.350
Look, I have to get to work,
so come to the office later.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.490
I just whipped up something simple
with what I had.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.220
I'll do some proper shopping
and make a real dinner tonight.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.220
Where's Manager Gong?

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.690
Oh, she said something urgent came up,
and she couldn't come home last night.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.700
So she really stayed out all night?

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.770
And all over one little thing I said.
Good grief.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.070
Did anything happen while we were out?

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.100
No, of course not.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.140
She's allowed to have a personal life,
you know.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.850
Come on, eat up.
You must be in a rush to get to work.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.680
Oh, right. I hear you're back at work
starting today?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.890
Word travels fast.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.990
Then again, I guess that makes sense
with Father right here.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
Congratulations.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.090
You'd better work hard.
You don't want to disgrace the chairman.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.060
You can't slack off like you used to.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.100
I know exactly what you're like.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.300
What's that supposed to mean?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.240
By the way, why haven't I seen
hide nor hair of that brat Se Ri?

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.140
She got home late last night with friends.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.380
She had a few drinks, too.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.910
She's still wet behind the ears.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.720
She has no right to get drunk
and sleep in.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.080
Go get her.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.020
Come on, don't be like that.
Shouldn't she be with friends at her age?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.660
She's growing up just fine for her age,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.860
so from now on,
don't scold Se Ri without my permission.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.490
I'll get angry if you do.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.310
Don't worry about Se Ri.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.440
Once she's slept it off,
I'll make sure she eats,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.510
and I'll get her something
for her hangover.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.080
She's my daughter.
I have to be the one to take care of her.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.730
(Mingang Distribution)

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.360
Director Moon, about that proposal
you made the other day...

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.600
The one about looking into our company's
cash flow that Lawyer Kim manages.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.670
So, are you considering
letting me handle it?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.770
I'll be honest,
your proposal did tempt me.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.540
After we spoke, I did some digging myself.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.950
It turns out we've given Lawyer Kim
far more authority than is typical.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.280
And with very few safeguards in place.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.290
Lawyer Kim impressed
the chairman early on,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.460
so many protocols were overlooked.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.090
But from now on,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.200
you need to put those safeguards in place,
just like with our other partners.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.270
How much should I trust you,
Director Moon?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.700
Well, that's up to you, of course.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.640
While I don't fully trust Lawyer Kim,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.380
that being said,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.810
I don't believe this is your place
to intervene.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.620
Between Lawyer Kim and me,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.390
we have a shared purpose
that's stronger than trust.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.220
I know his type very well.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.490
As long as our goals are aligned,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.200
neither of us has any reason
to betray the other.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.010
You may go.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.650
What was that with Director Moon?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120
It was nothing.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.130
I just had a personal matter
to discuss with him.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.730
A personal matter?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.400
You should discuss that with me.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.430
I'm a much better option than he is.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.930
And he couldn't possibly know your life
as well as I do.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.400
No.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.640
It had to be Director Moon.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.280
I don't know what business
you have with her,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.290
but cutting me out so you can whisper
is a bit out of line, isn't it?

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.690
So what is it you want to say now?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.790
When did you become close enough...

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.100
to discuss Ms. Min's personal business,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.770
but if you try to drive a wedge between us
or sow distrust,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.500
I won't let it slide.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.210
If you have nothing to hide, Lawyer Kim,
then there's no problem, is there?

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.610
So, what, you're saying I have
something to hide?

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.580
You'd know the answer to that better
than I would, wouldn't you?

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.220
Whether you're deceiving our superiors
and plotting to backstab them...

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.690
is something only you would know.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.220
And what about you?
Are you completely squeaky clean?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.690
Living a perfect life
with nothing to hide?

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.230
More than you are, at least.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.870
I don't know why you're so suspicious,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.330
but I'm not sloppy enough
to be taken down by you.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.440
So, dream on.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.670
Tailing me, digging into my life,
or stirring up trouble...

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.970
You won't get anywhere with any of it.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.410
Oh, there you all are.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320
Hello.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.990
Hey, Lawyer Kim.
What are you doing here?

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.620
You're back at work already?

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.360
Already? I should've been back ages ago.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360
Yes, speaking.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.970
Yes, I understand. I'll be right there.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.480
I was going to call,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.580
but I figured I might as well see
your handsome face in person.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.050
Oh. Well...

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.290
Actually, I needed to speak with you,
so this is good timing.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.990
And what's that?

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.960
It's about the ledgers you gave me
the other day.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.490
You said there were
five volumes in total...

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.500
Quiet.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.200
There's a little rat spying on us.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240
Don't turn around.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.210
Meet me at the hotel after work.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.360
Look at them, plotting something together
right out in the open.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.430
As soon as Baek Sul Hee disappears,
Stella Jang makes her entrance.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.230
So, in the end, the three of them
are on the same side.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.310
If I get you a job, you need to do it well
so you don't make me look bad.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.380
- I know that much, okay?
- You only say you do.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.450
This is your last chance.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.750
If you mess up one more time,
you can forget getting your job back.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.890
And it won't just be your job.
I'll kick you out of the house, you hear?

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.720
Yes, sir.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.290
What'd your father-in-law say?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.890
He didn't have any objections
about the non-executive director position?

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.430
Objections? Like what?

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.870
Like thanking his son's father...
That kind of thing.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.800
No, he didn't mention anything like that.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.300
Is that right?

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.880
Money...

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.550
So, there is something that can make
the great Min Doo Sik shake in his boots.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.020
Well, I guess you can't get away with
your sins forever.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.820
Let's see here.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.160
(Han Kyung Soo)

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.160
As long as I have this,
Mingang is practically in my hand.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.230
I should make a huge demand sometime soon.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.970
Half of Mingang?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.710
If he doesn't want to do time,
he'll have to do exactly as I say.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.510
Every single cent in the entire universe
will flow right into my grasp.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.380
Money...

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.230
(CEO Min Kyung Chae)

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.930
Come on in.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.530
Have a seat.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.910
What on earth is going on?

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.780
No one else will be coming in,
so please, speak freely.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.980
Kyung Chae,
I'm afraid I made a terrible mistake.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.650
What kind of mistake?

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.090
Should I tell her? Or not?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.990
Oh, come on.
So what if I got drunk and made a scene?

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.130
How am I supposed to know what I said?

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.830
Come on, what is it?

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.500
It's nothing.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.540
I just got on the chairman's bad side
for a bit yesterday,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.270
and I stormed out.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.670
It's no big deal.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.440
That's not...

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.910
Then come back to work.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.950
That's so unlike you, Manager Gong.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.260
Where have you been?
You stayed out all night without a word.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.890
Can I have a word with you?

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.510
I'm sorry.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480
Manager Gong.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.380
How about we grab a drink sometime?

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.920
- A drink?
- Yes, a drink.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.060
After all, nothing loosens the tongue
quite like a drink.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.030
They say drunken words are sober thoughts
for a reason.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.860
Is she onto me?

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.700
That darn alcohol.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.170
If only I could remember what I said.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.270
Let's set a date.
It's the best way to open up.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.210
We can clear the air too.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.840
Welcome home.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.760
I can't take this. I'm too on edge.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.200
Oh, Yeon Ah.
Hey, I have a quick question for you.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.440
It's about last night.
Did I say anything out of line?

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.840
- I didn't mention the family, did I?
- No.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.080
You didn't say anything like that at all.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.450
Really?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.650
Gosh, what a relief.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.150
The ledger Lucia smuggled out
is one of...

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.350
Chairman Min Doo Sik's slush fund ledgers,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.920
which Kim Sun Jae manages.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.760
I heard there were five volumes in total.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.030
Then Kim Sun Jae must have
the rest of them.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.200
Along with the accounting fraud books
and shell company documents.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.300
It's his insurance policy, so to speak.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.340
If he fails to become part of the family,

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.370
he plans to use them to make a killing.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.140
By the way...

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.380
Did you try leaking that info
about Kim Sun Jae to Min Kyung Chae?

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.950
Oh, yes.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.680
But their bond is stronger than I thought.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.420
Of course it is.
They have a complicated relationship.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.490
They're suspicious of one another,
but they also need each other.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.530
But one ledger alone won't be enough
to expose Kim Sun Jae's corruption.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.130
What should we do?

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.430
For now, you just keep driving a wedge...

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.000
between Kim Sun Jae and Min Kyung Chae.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.470
And one more thing.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.310
You need to get your father's contract
out of Oh Pan Sool's safe.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.280
But, Ms. Jang,

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.020
there's something I'd like to ask you.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.690
Why are you going to such lengths?

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.160
Who do you think this is a painting of?

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.870
Wait, isn't this Min Kyung Chae?

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.070
My son did this.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.310
He said she was the woman he loved.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.110
So your son and her...

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.350
He and Min Kyung Chae were lovers.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.980
Although he was brutally cast aside.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.920
I see.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.290
Then where is your son now?

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.020
He died...

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.720
in a car accident.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.760
But you know what's strange?

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.970
The driver who confessed to the accident
was a homeless man,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.240
but there's absolutely no way...

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.940
he could have been there
to cause a fatal accident.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.210
And yet, he insisted he was the one
who did it.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.910
As if someone had paid him
to take the fall.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.310
How could that happen?

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.750
It's just like what happened
to your parents, isn't it, Mr. Moon?

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.790
Do you understand now...

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.890
why I'm helping Lucia?

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:18.060
In the end, Min Doo Sik ruined all three
of our lives.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.570
Tae Joo, go to Oh Pan Sool's house soon
and get Han Kyung Soo's contract.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640
Yes.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.850
Of course, a stolen contract
won't hold up in court.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.550
But we can't just ignore
his last remaining weakness.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.120
It's time we get our hands on it.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.100
Sleep tight.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.670
Where are you going?

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.740
I'm going to sleep with Se Ri.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.140
Make me sleep alone so soon
after our wedding?

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.540
That's not very nice of you.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.710
I know, but I can't help it.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.820
Honestly, you're not the only reason
I married you.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.850
What kind of hurtful thing is that to say?

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.990
You didn't know?
I married you to be called Se Ri's mom.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.730
It has a nicer ring to it
than "the Chairman's wife."

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.600
Honestly, Se Ri is such an open book.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.370
The more love you give her,
the more she blossoms.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.300
Looks like Se Ri has finally
met her match.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.810
She was so starved for a mother's love
that she got scammed and went astray.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.740
She's finally hit the jackpot, that girl.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.240
Get some sleep.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.710
I don't even get a kiss?

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.380
What are you doing in my room?

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.350
To sleep with you.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.090
What about Dad?

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.650
But I'd rather be with you.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.590
Liar.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.460
No, I'm not.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.530
If you sleep with me once,
you'll have to do it every night.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.060
What's the big deal?
We'll just sleep together every night.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.870
Okay then, let's see
if you can handle sleeping with me.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.140
Hey!

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.640
I can't lose, either!

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.640
Hold on!

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.310
Got you first!

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.350
Gosh, my stomach hurts so much.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.450
Let me take a look.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.160
This is why people misunderstand you.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.360
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.230
The look on your face right now...

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.400
is the classic look of a mother
whose child is with some other woman.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.270
It's full of jealousy and resentment.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.270
Shut up.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.300
What do you know to be talking like that?

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.540
I told you, didn't I?

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.140
People are gossiping behind your back
that you're Se Ri's real mother.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.640
Who's spreading that kind of nonsense?

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.250
I know.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.150
I'm well aware that the hospital bills
are overdue.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.020
That's why I'm telling you I'm sorry.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.190
Since you've already waited this long,

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.330
if you can just be a little more patient,
I promise I'll take care of it.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.730
I'm sorry.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.540
Oh, excuse me.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.280
Thank you for working hard.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.080
I haven't seen you around.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.150
Are you new here?

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.180
- I'm just filling in for a friend.
- Oh, I see.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.550
Wait a second.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.620
I'm sure I know you from somewhere.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.160
Hey. You don't recognize me?

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.630
I don't think so.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.460
I don't believe we've met before.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.470
That can't be right.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.270
You look so familiar...

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.670
Gosh, that's it!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.770
CEO Han of Doeun Industries.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.850
Talk about a spitting image.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.950
You're a dead ringer for your father.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.660
You don't recognize me?
I used to work for your father's company.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.560
I... I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.130
I wouldn't know.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.900
Anyway, I'll let you get back to work.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.300
What? I'm sure I'm right.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.650
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.120
I'm Kim Sun Jae, an attorney from
the Mingang Distribution Legal Team.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.490
I saw you earlier by the elevators.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.090
And it looked like you
and Director Moon Tae Kyung...

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.460
knew each other.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.000
Moon Tae Kyung?

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.570
That's strange.
Why would he go by Moon Tae Kyung?

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.270
He has another name.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.300
Another name?

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.970
So I guess Moon Tae Kyung
isn't his real name?

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.780
Come on, just tell me what you know.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.380
Unbelievable.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.620
Here.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.920
What exactly do you know?

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.200
Excuse me.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.870
Who are you?

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.040
The gate was open, so I came in.
This is Number 23, right?

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.710
You foolish woman.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.610
If you leave the gate open,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.180
all sorts of people wander in.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.510
Who are you, barging into someone's house?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.880
Trespassing will land you in jail!
You want me to call the cops?

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.780
How about I just call the cops?

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.720
I'm so sorry.
I guess this isn't Number 23 after all.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.360
Goodness, Number 23 is next door.
You've got the wrong house, young man.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.590
I don't care where you have to go.
Get out now!

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:24.900
Actually, stay right where you are.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.630
I'll call the police. 1-1-2...

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.030
I'm sorry.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.940
What are you staring at?
Hurry up and get out!

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.210
That young man is just as handsome
as our tenant, Tae Kyung.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.540
Must be something in the water here.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.780
That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.820
You get googly-eyed over any young man.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.250
Make sure you lock the gate.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.090
There's money all over this place. Money!
Cash! Money, cash!

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.620
- Money!
- Stop it! You'll jinx us.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.130
It doesn't look like there are any other
security systems in the house.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.230
Then we just need to worry about
the CCTV in that room.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.370
If we cut the power, go in,
and find the safe.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.500
It won't be difficult.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.470
It's Doeun Industries's CEO Han's
new technology transfer agreement,

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.710
so make sure you get it.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.610
Yes, don't worry.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.050
Oh, Lucia, what's up?

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.050
Is Tae Joo there with you?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.550
Yes, he's here. Why?

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.450
Right now?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.320
Oh, okay. Got it.
I'll have him on standby.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.490
Se Ri.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.960
What are you doing in your room
on such a beautiful day?

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.300
Well...

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.040
Nothing much.
I don't have any plans or anything to do.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.470
Perfect. Want to go for a bike ride?

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.740
A bike ride?

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.410
But I don't know how to ride a bike.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.450
Even better. I can teach you.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.620
But still, how did you get to your age
without ever learning?

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.790
Well, you know how it is with bikes.
It's not like you can take a class for it.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.420
It's something your family is supposed
to teach you when you're little.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.560
You know how my family is.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.800
That's awful, really,
even if they were that busy...

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.500
If they actually cared,
would they have let that happen?

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.570
I'm getting upset just thinking about it.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.640
They've never really paid any attention
to me anyway.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.740
Better late than never. I'll teach you.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.370
Really?

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.980
Go on, get ready.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:23.550
We can ride bikes and get some snacks.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.650
Okay!

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.120
Se Ri, where are you off to?

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.290
I'm going bike riding with my mom.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.520
- Let's go!
- Okay.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.330
My goodness,
the way "Mom" just rolls off her tongue.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.500
You'd think Lucia was the birth mother.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.230
Don't you think?

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.840
- I know.
- You know, seeing Se Ri these days,

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.040
I feel so sorry for Se Ri's birth mother,
whoever she is.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:55.080
I mean, what's the point of going through
all that pregnancy and painful labor...

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.580
if some other woman gets to be
called "Mom?"

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.350
Gosh, this is scary.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.630
You're doing fine. Slow and steady.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.300
It's scary! I'm scared!
I think I'm going to fall!

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.800
You're doing great.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.000
- Keep your balance.
- Okay.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.170
You're doing great. That's it.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.570
Mom, you can't let go no matter what!

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.370
I won't, don't worry.
Just look ahead. I'm holding on tight.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.180
- Okay.
- I've got you.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.810
That's it. You're doing great.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.080
Look at you go, Se Ri. That's it.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.120
Hey, I'm doing it! I'm really doing it!

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.390
Oh, the light just changed!
Perfect timing!

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:54.840
Mom!

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.990
What's going on?
You never call this late.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.690
I'm busy, so I'll call you back.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.020
Are you the owner of this phone's sister?

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.330
Who is this?

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.230
I found this phone
at a car accident and called.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.200
A car accident?
What are you talking about?

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.200
Are you saying my Se Ri was
in a car accident?

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.700
She was taken away in an ambulance.
You should hurry.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.940
You'd better hurry.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.510
It was a major accident.
I doubt even surgery can help.

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.380
What do you mean?

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.650
Just how bad was the accident?

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.420
Hello?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.160
Was a 20-year-old woman
who was in a car accident brought in?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.470
I received a call saying she was here.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.170
Really? One moment.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.170
Excuse me, the car accident patient...

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.610
Is she in emergency surgery?

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.780
- Her name is Min Se Ri.
- Sorry, I wouldn't know.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.880
Why doesn't anyone know anything?

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.880
Where is my Se Ri?

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.780
Where is Se Ri?

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.190
Excuse me, are you looking for the student
brought in from the car accident?

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.120
Where is she? Right now?

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.290
She was just taken to the operating room.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.390
It's that way.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.770
(Operating Theater Center)

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.140
This can't be happening.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.780
This can't be happening.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.250
Save my daughter.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.920
Save my daughter!
I said, save my daughter!

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.520
Se Ri!

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.190
Se Ri!

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.260
No!

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.460
No!

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.600
No, this isn't real. Se Ri.
Se Ri, wake up!

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.500
This can't be.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.500
No.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.500
No!

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.370
So, it was Se Ri after all.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.040
Min Kyung Chae,
the very daughter you gave birth to.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.750
Just you wait.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.720
Now that I know Se Ri is your daughter,

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.580
I'll make absolutely sure...

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.750
that she never calls you her mother.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.160
Se Ri!

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.630
Kyung Chae!

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.470
What happened? Why are you here?

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:40.870
Are you okay?

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.170
You're not hurt, are you?

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.910
It's just a little scratch. Why?

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.520
Mom!

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.690
(Operating Theater Center)

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.230
- Did it hurt a lot?
- A little.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.790
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.310
I'll make sure she dies without
ever hearing her daughter call her "Mom."

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.380
That's the only way she'll understand
a fraction of the pain of losing a child.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.250
You know the man who's been posing as
Director Moon Tae Kyung.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.550
Tell me what you know about him.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.090
You have to trust me.
Just as you always have.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.220
I'm going to find out who you are...

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.390
and make sure
you end up as your father did.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.860
I will never let that happen.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.070
