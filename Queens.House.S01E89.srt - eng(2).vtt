00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:02.309
(Episode 89)

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:06.849
By any chance, is this person's name Catherine?

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:16.659
Tae Ho?

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:18.959
No.

00:00:20.299 --> 00:00:21.869
This woman is not my sister.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.399
I don't know what's going on,

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.739
but why are you asking about my sister?

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.279
Please don't get the wrong idea. It's not your sister,

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.009
it's this woman we want to know about.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.519
This woman is posing as your sister, Catherine.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:43.119
It's a case of identity theft. We must find her link to Catherine.

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:44.519
That's what we want to find out.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:46.119
I wonder.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:49.389
Do you think she was close to Catherine?

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.659
No.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:54.729
Kang Se Ri.

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:56.599
That woman...

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.739
We dated briefly.

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.249
Is Lee Tae Ho in the office building?

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:12.719
Yes.

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:17.319
But I haven't even sent him the catalogue or the contract.

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:19.889
He must be on his way up, then.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.229
Actually, I don't think he's here to see you, sir.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.869
He went to DH Holdings' Investment and Development Team a while ago.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.069
We'd like to know more about Kang Se Ri.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.669
Could you tell us about her?

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.409
I'm sorry, but that's a private matter.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719
I'm not even sure what's going on myself.

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:46.989
It looks like I need to do my own digging.

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:49.789
We can talk again after that.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.259
All right. I'm sorry if we were too personal.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:57.029
Not at all.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.399
Anyway, our purpose was to meet with Designer L, wasn't it?

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.539
I'll email you the proposal we discussed on the way over.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:07.139
Okay.

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:08.939
I need you to review it favourably.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.339
If we showcase an exhibition hall revamped with Designer L's style,

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.779
I think it will be a meaningful gift for the visitors.

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.249
My whole team is really excited about it.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.519
I'll think it over.

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.529
Well, I should get going.

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.259
Should we meet separately tomorrow?

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.259
No, we got the answer we needed.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:35.169
We'll see you around.

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:36.729
Take care.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.039
Hello.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:43.939
I heard you were in the building and came to say hello.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.449
- I hope I'm not interrupting. - Not at all.

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.749
We had just finished up and were about to see him out.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.489
Goodbye, then.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.819
Please let me know about the proposal.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:58.819
Yes, I'll be in touch.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:05.859
Please come to my office.

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.499
Thank you, but I'm only here to meet Designer L,

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.699
which is why I didn't contact you beforehand.

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.669
It's about the project I mentioned, the one I want to work with L on.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.009
I came to propose it to her in person.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.179
Of course, this is scheduled for after my YL Group contract ends,

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.849
so you don't need to concern yourself.

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.919
May I ask...

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.519
what your meeting with DH Holdings was about?

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:33.019
It turns out Patrick is good friends with a long-time U.S. client.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.199
I guess he heard I was coming here and reached out to Patrick himself.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.129
You seem to have a great deal of interest in my affairs.

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.429
Please don't get the wrong idea.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.899
I was simply curious.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.509
I see. Well, I'll see you soon.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.419
Mi Sook? What brings you here?

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:08.689
I came to talk.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.329
I'm glad you came here. Please have a seat.

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.769
Actually, after your acquittal and the news of the reinvestigation,

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.869
I was hoping that while you can still remember,

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.079
I wanted to have a good, long talk and clear the air.

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.349
I'm sorry I was acquitted.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:31.419
How can you say that?

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.349
Even though it was all a misunderstanding,

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.749
and even though I didn't kill Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee,

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:42.659
the things I said to her because I was mistaken,

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:43.859
and my actions...

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:49.399
I can't take any of it back or undo it.

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.269
So I still feel guilty, and I am truly sorry.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.309
Thank you for apologising.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:01.279
I know my Do Hee better than anyone.

00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:05.449
She would accept a sincere apology and knew how to forgive.

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:08.689
Would you like to go with me to see her sometime?

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:12.889
- I can? - Of course.

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:17.159
I'll tell her that her mom has made a new, close friend.

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.739
Now, you and Mr. Kang Seung Woo...

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.209
are free from the false accusations.

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.109
All that's left is to put the real culprit away.

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:31.739
So it's such a relief.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:34.279
I can finally breathe again.

00:05:36.049 --> 00:05:37.049
Seung Woo?

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:43.089
I have to go see my Seung Woo.

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.859
It's his first office job, so he must feel out of place.

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:49.329
I'll go with you.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:51.759
If you're going, I'm going with you.

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:56.029
The number you've called is unavailable.

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:57.129
Connecting to voicemail...

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.809
Why isn't Ms. Choi answering her phone?

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.789
Son, are you okay?

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.649
Are your superiors giving you a hard time?

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:19.419
Honestly, your father is just too much.

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:22.429
As if making Jae In start as a regular staffer wasn't enough,

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:25.029
you have to suffer like this too?

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:29.329
No, Mom. I'm actually really happy with it.

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.269
I already made Assistant Manager.

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:34.309
Really?

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.179
Then again, my son can do anything.

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.409
We were having a nice chat,

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:45.749
and I guess she suddenly thought of you.

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.119
Now that she's found you, I'll get going.

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.759
Okay. Thank you for bringing my mom here.

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.459
I'll take it from here.

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.929
Mom, you know that flower cafe you like?

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.169
Do you want to go grab a cup of coffee there?

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:09.209
Oh, I'd love that!

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:26.219
Yun Hee!

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.359
What brings you here without calling first?

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:32.259
Ja Young came by my place, and we talked for a bit.

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.769
But then she got a bit disoriented again.

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:37.799
She said she had to see her son, but I couldn't just let her go alone.

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:40.169
You did the right thing.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.639
Anyway, time to get back to work.

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:49.549
Bring him home for a visit sometime.

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:53.419
Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo.

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:55.249
Really?

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:58.059
He grew up oblivious to everything. How is any of this his fault?

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:00.929
Bring him over. I'll make him a home-cooked meal.

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:03.259
I'm off.

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:12.039
It looks like your mother's starting to warm up to him.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.399
Right?

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:21.609
(Executive Director Kang Mi Ran)

00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:28.219
Did Ja Young stop by while I was in my meeting?

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:31.459
Yes, I was just on my way back after taking her home.

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:33.219
Director Do is watching her at home.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.559
Good.

00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:37.529
From now on,

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:42.669
she'll probably come looking for me whenever she's not doing well.

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:45.299
I'm sure she will.

00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:49.739
And I plan on checking in on her more often too.

00:08:52.539 --> 00:08:53.579
And eventually,

00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:55.709
if a time comes...

00:08:56.179 --> 00:08:58.549
when she can no longer manage on her own,

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:02.949
I'm even considering moving in with her.

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:08.429
To me, she will always...

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:10.659
be my mom.

00:09:12.099 --> 00:09:13.829
That's one thing that will never change.

00:09:15.169 --> 00:09:18.539
She's the one who raised me and loved me.

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:21.539
That's because she was my mom.

00:09:22.839 --> 00:09:24.779
So now, it's my turn to give back...

00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:27.779
all the love she has given me.

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:31.979
That's what it means to be a decent human being and a son.

00:09:36.349 --> 00:09:37.489
Seung Woo.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.619
You're right.

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:42.929
I know exactly where you're coming from.

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:46.299
I know you were worried about me,

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.899
but I'm okay.

00:09:49.329 --> 00:09:50.669
You should do whatever you want to do.

00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:52.699
Whatever you want...

00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:54.439
is what I want too.

00:09:56.139 --> 00:09:57.209
That's all that matters to me.

00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:01.809
You know, even though my mother is still alive,

00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:07.519
my birth mother may be Choi Ja Young,

00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:13.989
but today, I really wanted to say this to you.

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:21.299
Thank you.

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:23.269
Mom.

00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:30.109
I should get going.

00:11:00.469 --> 00:11:03.439
(YL group)

00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:05.479
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:11.319
I have very high expectations.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:16.189
First, I'd like to take a close look at the pieces.

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:18.889
By all means.

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.229
You'll be even more impressed by the artistry...

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:22.529
when you see it in person.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:27.399
It's been a while since you were last in Korea.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.199
Have you had a chance to do any sightseeing?

00:11:30.129 --> 00:11:32.869
You know, Korea is more dynamic than any other country.

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:35.539
I came here to rest, but work has just piled up.

00:11:36.469 --> 00:11:38.179
To be honest, more than seeing the tourist sites,

00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:40.409
I've been more curious about what a Korean home is like.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:42.649
Like the way people live,

00:11:43.109 --> 00:11:46.219
home-cooked meals and their diet, you know.

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:47.989
I see.

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:50.089
I suppose it's because of my Korean roots.

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:53.489
I don't have any relatives here, so I haven't had the chance.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:11:59.699
It's much better to have a home base when you're working.

00:12:00.299 --> 00:12:02.429
Staying in a hotel just doesn't feel very grounding.

00:12:03.229 --> 00:12:04.839
Maybe that's why I've been struggling a bit lately.

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:10.069
Well then, how would you like to stay at my home for a while?

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:13.209
That's all right. I couldn't possibly impose.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:15.079
Nonsense, it's no imposition at all.

00:12:16.079 --> 00:12:17.109
We have a spare room,

00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:18.979
and we can easily set another plate.

00:12:20.619 --> 00:12:23.119
In fact, why not come over today?

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.219
Really? Would that be all right?

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:28.989
Of course. I invited you, didn't I?

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.859
Please make yourself at home.

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:35.799
Excuse me.

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:38.269
Oh, Tae Ho?

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.339
What brings you here?

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.139
Do you have a moment?

00:12:42.369 --> 00:12:43.909
There's something I could use your help with.

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:47.979
Could we maybe talk outside?

00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:49.849
It looks like it's about time for lunch.

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:52.079
Sure.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:56.249
Mr. Kang, go get some lunch. I'm heading out for some too.

00:12:58.219 --> 00:12:59.219
A toy?

00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:01.389
It's not for me.

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:04.189
I'm going to be staying at an acquaintance's home for a bit,

00:13:04.499 --> 00:13:05.799
and they have a child.

00:13:06.729 --> 00:13:08.169
I'd like to get them a small gift,

00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:10.569
but I'm not sure what to get.

00:13:11.439 --> 00:13:12.639
How old is the kid?

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:14.269
Seven.

00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:20.409
Let's go. You bought lunch, so let me help.

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:22.149
You'd do that?

00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:24.249
Thanks.

00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:34.529
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:39.459
We're not home. Stop waltzing in and out.

00:13:40.359 --> 00:13:41.499
Look at this.

00:13:42.499 --> 00:13:43.499
I'm not interested.

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:44.899
Just look at it.

00:13:45.439 --> 00:13:46.439
Look.

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:52.409
See?

00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:55.149
Do you think a woman like that would ever come back to you?

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:58.419
Kang Jae In has absolutely no interest in you.

00:14:00.349 --> 00:14:01.419
Get over her.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.459
That meeting wasn't about Jae In. It was business with a Designer L.

00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:06.919
Are you out of your mind?

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:09.929
How can you possibly defend her?

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:11.429
Just go home early today.

00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:15.699
We have an important guest coming over, so get dinner ready.

00:14:18.169 --> 00:14:20.639
I guess he still sees me as his wife after all.

00:14:21.439 --> 00:14:25.479
Fine. You'll see just how perfect a wife I can be for you.

00:14:29.349 --> 00:14:30.349
Who is this person, anyway?

00:14:30.409 --> 00:14:31.679
What's all the fuss about?

00:14:32.549 --> 00:14:33.979
Who is this person we have to impress?

00:14:34.349 --> 00:14:36.719
Yes. He's staying with us for a while.

00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:38.489
Mother, be on your best behaviour.

00:14:38.859 --> 00:14:41.629
A single word from him can move fortunes.

00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:44.089
He must be quite the big shot.

00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:47.199
Excuse me.

00:14:49.599 --> 00:14:50.599
Welcome, come in.

00:14:51.369 --> 00:14:52.369
Welcome.

00:14:54.439 --> 00:14:58.079
You know, you look familiar.

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:01.349
Have we met somewhere before?

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.149
Ji Ho, you should say hello.

00:15:07.349 --> 00:15:08.349
Hello.

00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:11.789
Well, hello.

00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:14.119
Is your name Ji Ho?

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:15.529
Yes.

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:23.899
Ta-da!

00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:25.539
A present for you.

00:15:26.439 --> 00:15:28.769
This is my favourite!

00:15:29.469 --> 00:15:30.539
Thank you!

00:15:36.849 --> 00:15:38.579
Let's get your bags settled before we eat.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:41.349
Honey, I'll show him to his room.

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:42.749
You stay here with Ji Ho.

00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:44.389
Okay, sure.

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:47.519
Once you're unpacked, come on down and we'll have dinner.

00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:51.089
Okay. Thank you for having me.

00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:57.839
What do you think you're doing?

00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:59.769
I told you not to pull any stunts!

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:02.539
I haven't done a thing.

00:16:03.239 --> 00:16:05.179
You're the one who's been pulling stunts.

00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:07.609
Why would you do that?

00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:12.219
- That's what I'm here to find out. - What is that supposed to mean?

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:14.049
What exactly have I done?

00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:19.359
- Lee Tae Ho. - Catherine.

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.059
What have you been doing using my sister's name?

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:28.199
- I can explain that. - Hwang Ji Ho.

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:32.599
How long were you planning to hide the fact that he's my son?

00:16:33.969 --> 00:16:35.439
What? What are you talking about?

00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:37.509
Who says he's your son?

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:38.879
That's not true.

00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:47.889
Mom, Dad says to hurry down.

00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:56.029
Okay. Go on downstairs, Ji Ho.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.559
Ji Ho.

00:16:58.929 --> 00:17:00.829
How about we go downstairs together?

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.549
Please enjoy your meal, Mr. Lee.

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:23.419
A spread like this is...

00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:26.689
what's called a Korean royal feast, right?

00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:31.399
I told Mom you're an honoured guest, so it looks like she went all out.

00:17:34.099 --> 00:17:38.499
I only used the very best ingredients and seasoning.

00:17:40.639 --> 00:17:43.969
I'm just asking out of artistic curiosity,

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:48.549
what's the most expensive painting you've ever sold?

00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:52.019
Well, I don't really keep a ranking.

00:17:52.619 --> 00:17:55.619
If you mean the most expensive piece I've brokered recently...

00:17:56.189 --> 00:17:58.159
It was around a hundred million dollars.

00:17:58.789 --> 00:18:00.759
A hundred million dollars?

00:18:02.629 --> 00:18:04.289
How much is a hundred million dollars?

00:18:05.999 --> 00:18:06.999
Around 100 billion won.

00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:10.669
Oh my gosh.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:16.639
Here, please, eat up, Mr. Lee.

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:21.409
It's customary to introduce everyone.

00:18:21.749 --> 00:18:23.179
Shall I introduce my family?

00:18:23.849 --> 00:18:24.849
That'd be great.

00:18:25.949 --> 00:18:27.449
This is the homewrecker.

00:18:28.949 --> 00:18:29.989
Gi Man.

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:33.119
What? It's how the online videos say.

00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:36.259
My brother's wife, the homewrecker, stole her friend's husband.

00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:37.489
Is that correct?

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:39.229
Hey, Gi Man.

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:41.299
You should probably just eat.

00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:45.669
I can't eat fast. I get indigestion. You should eat slowly and chew well.

00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:47.269
Okay, fine. Slowly then.

00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:49.939
Please can we just eat first?

00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:51.679
Okay.

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:56.079
As you've probably figured out,

00:18:56.649 --> 00:18:58.649
my brother suffered a head injury in an accident.

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:00.319
So he's a little...

00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:02.289
Please bear with him.

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:05.719
I'm so down. Maybe fillers would cheer me up.

00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:08.189
And I do need to get another facelift.

00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:43.559
What's your game?

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:47.699
I told you he was not your son. He's not.

00:19:48.099 --> 00:19:49.269
Should we get a paternity test?

00:19:52.069 --> 00:19:53.099
Fine.

00:19:54.199 --> 00:19:56.469
He may be your son, biologically.

00:19:58.179 --> 00:20:01.009
But he's grown up his whole life believing Gi Chan is his father.

00:20:01.279 --> 00:20:02.279
And you told him I was dead?

00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:06.549
I did. After we split, you were dead to me.

00:20:07.479 --> 00:20:10.689
Let's be honest. We were both dirt-poor.

00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:13.189
We were in no position to have and raise a child,

00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:14.559
and I didn't want to have the baby.

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:17.729
I didn't want to pass my poverty on to my child.

00:20:20.129 --> 00:20:22.669
And then I met a man who could provide for my child.

00:20:23.829 --> 00:20:25.139
My husband.

00:20:26.699 --> 00:20:29.669
Our Ji Ho has grown up wanting for nothing.

00:20:30.209 --> 00:20:31.879
I've given him everything he could ever want.

00:20:33.439 --> 00:20:35.109
I'm not going to let our family fall apart.

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.309
I'm not just going to stand by and watch.

00:20:42.689 --> 00:20:44.489
If you do anything to hurt my Ji Ho,

00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:47.589
I will make you regret it.

00:20:49.259 --> 00:20:50.529
I'll kill you.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:55.369
So just tell me.

00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:57.799
What is it you want?

00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:59.799
Tell me!

00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:03.509
I have no intention...

00:21:03.509 --> 00:21:05.179
of turning a happy kid's life upside down.

00:21:06.209 --> 00:21:07.239
Do you really mean that?

00:21:07.779 --> 00:21:09.809
I do, as long as you and your family...

00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:13.519
are a good influence on Ji Ho.

00:21:14.989 --> 00:21:15.989
What's that supposed to mean?

00:21:16.649 --> 00:21:17.819
Don't get so defensive.

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:20.489
If you're a mother who can face her child...

00:21:20.489 --> 00:21:21.629
with a clear conscience,

00:21:22.289 --> 00:21:24.029
then I have no desire to interfere.

00:21:24.389 --> 00:21:25.559
What is that supposed to mean?

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:28.059
What do I have to be ashamed of?

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:29.529
Well...

00:21:30.569 --> 00:21:32.599
I don't have all the details just yet.

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:35.339
Then why would you say something like that?

00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:37.269
Is that what Kang Jae In said?

00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:38.779
That I should be ashamed of myself?

00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:44.149
You know the Korean saying,

00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:46.279
"A guilty conscience needs no accuser."

00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:49.019
Because that's certainly what it sounds like to me.

00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:51.589
Let's not go over this again.

00:21:53.159 --> 00:21:55.329
If you're truly a fit mother,

00:21:56.329 --> 00:21:58.059
I'll go right back to the U.S.

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:00.199
Deal?

00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:25.489
Hard at work, I see.

00:22:26.659 --> 00:22:28.529
I'm a hard worker by nature.

00:22:29.689 --> 00:22:30.889
Are you free this evening?

00:22:31.129 --> 00:22:32.559
I was hoping we could have dinner.

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:35.729
Is it for the drink you gave me for the detective the other day?

00:22:36.569 --> 00:22:39.369
I did promise it'd be my treat. Sure.

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:41.769
Okay, let's meet up after work.

00:22:42.469 --> 00:22:43.509
Sounds good.

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:47.879
I'm just going to grab some coffee.

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:50.679
Why do you have to report that to me?

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:53.149
I have no intention of getting in the way of an office romance.

00:22:53.449 --> 00:22:54.649
I guess that's what you mean, right?

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:16.169
We don't have anything work-related to talk about today, do we?

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:18.739
Oh, this isn't about work.

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:23.479
Did I mention Yun Hee wanted to have Seung Woo over?

00:23:24.449 --> 00:23:27.079
Yes, and you also mentioned you told her he was your son.

00:23:27.879 --> 00:23:30.689
I'm planning on taking him to dinner with them tonight.

00:23:33.319 --> 00:23:36.159
Are you sure that's okay with taking only Mr. Kang Seung Woo?

00:23:37.589 --> 00:23:39.199
Seung Woo has done nothing wrong.

00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:41.929
If Seung Woo can only meet them first,

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:46.069
and it's a chance to naturally get closer to your family,

00:23:46.439 --> 00:23:47.499
that would be wonderful.

00:23:48.809 --> 00:23:51.109
Next time we get a chance,

00:23:51.369 --> 00:23:52.609
the three of us can go together.

00:23:54.609 --> 00:23:56.349
Don't worry about me,

00:23:57.009 --> 00:23:59.649
I hope you two have a nice, cosy dinner.

00:24:10.229 --> 00:24:11.529
How do you know when my break is?

00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:15.299
How do you always show up the second I step out for coffee?

00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:21.269
I can't really explain it. I just think of you, and you appear.

00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:23.309
It's like you're sending me signals or something.

00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:26.379
I'm definitely not sending you any signals.

00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:29.649
I'm on your side, no matter what.

00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:32.719
I know Gi Chan was completely in the wrong.

00:24:33.349 --> 00:24:37.589
I don't know much, but he did cheat and treat Jae In terribly.

00:24:38.089 --> 00:24:41.489
But that has nothing to do with me. I've never taken his side.

00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:42.929
I swear.

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:48.929
Besides, once I get married, I'm out of that family anyway.

00:24:49.129 --> 00:24:51.399
So I'm telling you I will always be on your side.

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:53.439
I'll put it in writing right now if you want.

00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:56.809
What will you do if I actually have it notarized?

00:24:57.339 --> 00:24:59.879
I wouldn't care. It's what my heart wants.

00:25:00.309 --> 00:25:04.779
How can you be so sure about this?

00:25:05.979 --> 00:25:07.719
Because you're the one I like.

00:25:08.219 --> 00:25:10.519
I believe in making clear whose side you're on.

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:13.689
Especially when it's about someone I care about,

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:16.059
they need to know, without a doubt, that I'm on their side.

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:27.469
All right, here we are.

00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:29.309
Come on in.

00:25:32.809 --> 00:25:33.839
Hello.

00:25:35.509 --> 00:25:36.549
This is for you.

00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:40.019
Thank you.

00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:42.349
Thank you so much for having me.

00:25:43.249 --> 00:25:46.489
Patrick invited me over for a home-cooked meal.

00:25:46.989 --> 00:25:47.989
We're glad you could make it.

00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:50.489
We've all been looking forward to meeting you.

00:25:50.889 --> 00:25:52.759
Bo Ram, say hello.

00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:57.769
Hi, handsome! I'm Kim Bo Ram.

00:25:57.829 --> 00:25:59.739
Bo Ram, I wouldn't call him handsome.

00:25:59.739 --> 00:26:01.569
He's on par with me.

00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:03.969
Kids don't lie.

00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:05.809
He's way more handsome than you.

00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:09.579
Like by this much!

00:26:09.949 --> 00:26:11.279
I like him.

00:26:15.689 --> 00:26:17.919
- Please have a seat. Okay? - Oh, sure.

00:26:17.989 --> 00:26:19.589
- Let's sit. - Right this way.

00:26:20.919 --> 00:26:23.489
It's not much, but please enjoy.

00:26:24.129 --> 00:26:27.059
Did you really make all this for me?

00:26:28.359 --> 00:26:29.999
I wasn't sure what you'd like.

00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:32.699
I hope the seasoning is okay.

00:26:40.879 --> 00:26:42.749
This is absolutely delicious.

00:26:42.979 --> 00:26:47.019
This is nothing. My sister's a master at cooking.

00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:49.689
Here, try one. It'll knock your socks off.

00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:52.719
Here you go.

00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:04.069
Good!

00:27:04.569 --> 00:27:05.569
See?

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:15.649
You have some too, Do Yun.

00:27:18.109 --> 00:27:20.379
You enjoy your food too, Bo Ram.

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:21.679
Okay.

00:27:21.749 --> 00:27:24.319
All right. Mom, you eat up too!

00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:26.689
Oh, goodness, all right.

00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:29.089
Honestly, you'd think we were doing the wave.

00:27:29.829 --> 00:27:31.229
Hey, you eat too.

00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:34.659
Oh, right. Here, Bo Ram, have some of this too.

00:27:34.659 --> 00:27:36.129
Come on.

00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:40.339
- Let's eat. - Okay.

00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:45.679
- How is it? Is it good? - It's delicious.

00:27:45.739 --> 00:27:47.009
Good. Eat up, everyone.

00:27:55.749 --> 00:27:56.749
Did they leave all right?

00:27:56.819 --> 00:28:01.089
Yes, at first, he was dragging his feet,

00:28:01.089 --> 00:28:02.129
but he must've had a good time.

00:28:02.589 --> 00:28:04.329
He asked to be invited again.

00:28:04.889 --> 00:28:05.899
Thanks, Yun Hee.

00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:07.759
He's really grown up well.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:10.499
Even if Ja Young said she resented him,

00:28:10.499 --> 00:28:11.769
you can see she raised him lovingly.

00:28:12.569 --> 00:28:14.799
You can tell if a child was raised with love...

00:28:15.209 --> 00:28:16.269
or without it.

00:28:17.809 --> 00:28:18.809
Oh Seong.

00:28:19.409 --> 00:28:21.739
He'll find out anyway, so just tell him.

00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:24.449
Putting it off won't solve anything.

00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:26.519
He'll be so shocked. You need to be there for him.

00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:28.049
Right?

00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:31.849
I tell myself I have to tell him, but the words just won't come out.

00:28:32.689 --> 00:28:35.189
You're making it complicated by overthinking things.

00:28:35.529 --> 00:28:37.189
Stop thinking and just tell him.

00:28:38.229 --> 00:28:39.899
That saying, "blood is thicker than water."

00:28:39.899 --> 00:28:41.029
I saw that today.

00:28:42.199 --> 00:28:43.229
You two look alike.

00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:44.769
We do?

00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:46.969
So we do look alike.

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:01.879
Ms. Jae In? It's Bo Ram.

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:03.449
What are you doing?

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:06.889
Bo Ram, you shouldn't call when she's busy.

00:29:07.159 --> 00:29:09.429
I called because I missed you.

00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:11.159
My uncle is here with me too.

00:29:13.529 --> 00:29:14.599
He's working.

00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:20.599
Okay. Bye, Ms. Jae In.

00:29:23.309 --> 00:29:26.079
Uncle Do Yun, "working overtime" means working really late, right?

00:29:26.409 --> 00:29:29.579
Yes. How do you know that word?

00:29:29.879 --> 00:29:33.279
Mom used to say that at her company.

00:29:35.219 --> 00:29:38.289
Ms. Jae In is working at her office right now, right?

00:29:39.259 --> 00:29:40.259
Probably.

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:44.629
But it's scary and dangerous for her to go home alone at night.

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:46.859
Let's go meet her.

00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:48.529
What?

00:29:48.729 --> 00:29:52.199
Come on, please?

00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:53.439
Should we?

00:30:01.179 --> 00:30:03.209
- Ms. Jae In! - Bo Ram!

00:30:04.249 --> 00:30:07.679
- Hi! Have you been okay? - Yes.

00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:09.949
Have you been waiting long?

00:30:10.319 --> 00:30:11.589
No, I just came down.

00:30:12.089 --> 00:30:14.719
- How about work? All done? - Yes.

00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:18.829
- Bo Ram, I missed you so much. - Me too.

00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:26.039
- Okay. - What should we get to eat?

00:30:26.499 --> 00:30:28.169
- Ice cream! - Ice cream?

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:29.569
Hey, you already had one on the way here.

00:30:39.849 --> 00:30:40.849
Honey!

00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:42.319
Eun Ho!

00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:44.849
This is so good.

00:31:22.689 --> 00:31:25.129
Uncle, who's that man?

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:27.359
Why is he taking Ms. Jae In?

00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:32.199
Well, I guess she had other plans.

00:31:44.409 --> 00:31:45.419
Are you crazy?

00:31:45.949 --> 00:31:46.949
Stop the car.

00:31:48.849 --> 00:31:50.989
I said stop! Stop the car!

00:31:52.359 --> 00:31:53.459
Hwang Gi Chan!

00:32:22.289 --> 00:32:23.319
What do you think you're doing?

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:25.519
A kidnapping? What's wrong with you?

00:32:26.659 --> 00:32:28.259
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:33.329
- How can you not know? - I don't know! I just don't!

00:32:35.729 --> 00:32:37.369
I think I can't live without you.

00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:40.999
I can't stand seeing you with some other guy!

00:32:42.839 --> 00:32:45.709
I guess I'm still in love with you.

00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:32.519
(Queen's House)

00:33:34.819 --> 00:33:36.129
What do you think you're doing?

00:33:37.059 --> 00:33:39.929
Don't you dare lay a hand on Jae In again!

00:33:41.759 --> 00:33:44.899
- Who do you think you are? - Because I love Jae In.

00:33:45.069 --> 00:33:46.899
Just a year before Ji Ho came along,

00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:49.369
didn't you say you'd rather not have kids?

00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:51.309
That's what Chairman Hwang Gi Chan told me.

00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:55.179
- Well, you see... - A year before Ji Ho came along?

00:33:56.179 --> 00:33:58.249
That was before you and I had even met.

00:33:58.849 --> 00:34:02.589
You keep showing up at home and work just to torment me!

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:04.419
Go back to the U.S. right now!
