00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.430
(Song Joong Ki)

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.140
(Chun Woo Hee)

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.570
(Lee Joo Myung)

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.580
(Seo Ji Hun)

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.960
(My Youth)

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.230
Hey, you're about to touch me.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.230
You're going to touch me! Hey!

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.940
You touched me!

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.570
Relax, I'm not going to bite.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.950
If you don't like it, pull away.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.330
And if I do?

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.230
Then I'm in luck.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.839
Hey!

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.480
You're really strong.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.350
What have I just done?

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.910
Well, it's just...

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.550
So, when would have been a good time?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.919
No, it's just...

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.149
Like, after we got here?

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.859
Or after I dropped you off?

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.190
No, it's not about the timing, it's just...

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.030
Let's just go quietly.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.660
I'm... I'm tired.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.470
Hey.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.540
It'll be more awkward if we stay quiet.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.140
Right?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.870
Why are you smiling?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840
Because it's awkward.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.850
Hey.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.150
Hey.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.550
(Episode 5)

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.430
Yes, I figured.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.000
It's like I saw it coming.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.430
I thought you wanted it to be quiet.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.970
I said quiet, not silent.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.810
Why did you...

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.810
do it?

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.010
Because I wanted to.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.710
Aren't you...

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.380
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.250
Why are you embarrassed?

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.420
- I'm thinking. - Gosh.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.320
We're two adults. We can kiss if we want to.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.629
What, so just because we're adults?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.730
Without any feelings,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400
people just do that?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.700
Who said I have no feelings?

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.740
I held back yesterday.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.580
We had to share a room, which would have made things really awkward...

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.720
I said I was thinking.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.190
Gosh, fine.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.060
Calm down.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.230
I'll wait outside.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.050
Want a ride?

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.949
Well...

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.350
Oh, right. You'd say no because it's awkward.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.249
Should I take the hint and just go?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.890
Then why did you even ask?

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.790
Good point.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.430
Just get in. I won't say a word.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.429
What? What is it?

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.729
What? Why?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.899
Gosh, you scared me.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.829
Seriously, what's with you?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.569
Hey, why are you coming at me like that?

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.839
Why are you doing this?

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.970
My bag is in your car.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.610
- Gosh. - Oh, right.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.760
Please don't contact me for a while.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.560
Hey.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.469
That's not going to work.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.469
What? What do you mean? Why not?

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.529
Look.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.239
You'll use "needing time to think" as an excuse to ghost me.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.710
Hey, come on. What do you take me for?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.980
It's just...

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.479
It was all so sudden.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.650
What happens to us now?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.850
We kissed, so we can't go back to how we were.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.420
Well, then.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.719
Option 1, things get awkward. Option 2, things get complicated.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.390
Option three, we start dating.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.530
Let's think about it.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.770
I'm leaving.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.440
Don't try to stop me. Please.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.370
If it had been some other guy, would you have let him live?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.740
Back then, you...

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.410
You were so...

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.950
Give me the car keys.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.650
I'll go sleep in the car.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.220
Hey, I didn't even get to the part where I said you...

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.460
sparkled.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.930
It'll be beautiful when it blooms.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.500
Talk about stating the obvious.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.899
Don't you want to know what the flower means?

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.900
Not in the slightest.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.399
It's for a friend you've parted ways with...

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.140
If you don't want to be buried here, be quiet. I'm tired.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.439
If you're going to drag me all the way out here,

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.510
you could at least put some effort into the re-enactment, shouldn't you?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.140
I'm not enjoying this either, you know.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.520
If it had been any other guy, I don't think I would've spared him.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.690
Your back was a little...

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.720
It was actually pretty warm.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.810
Gosh.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.170
Gosh.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.440
What a nightmare.

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.500
Oh, no. A burglar.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.800
If you're off to the flower market, you could at least have told me.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.380
So what if you avoid me?

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.520
What, are the grades going to change if I see them tonight?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.819
Hand it over. Your report card.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.989
It's about my mood! It just feels different.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.060
Fine.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.440
(Report Card)

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.079
You ranked 200th out of 206 students?

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.379
Why would you read that out loud?

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.719
Why not? There's no one here to hear it.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.050
Gosh, that's my point! Why say it when no one else is here?

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.390
I see.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.460
Here you go.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.300
If you weren't even going to scold me,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.000
why did you keep asking for my report card?

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.499
Why can't you just say, "Good job," or "You could've done better?"

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.540
Is that something you just don't do?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.370
I was so worried for nothing, afraid you'd yell about my grades.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.080
Honestly, it's actually kind of anticlimactic.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.180
Are you happy with these grades?

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.280
Happy now?

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.650
You're so annoying.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.990
Nu Ri.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.129
Why are you here so early today?

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.330
Getting to school early seemed like the better option.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.900
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.570
Hold on tight, Choi Sa Rang.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.179
What? You're up early.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.809
I was just about to come up.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.979
We've only been apart a few days, but it feels like forever.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.219
Good to see you.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.719
What's with you?

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.159
Did you have another bad night's sleep?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.390
I'm trying to sleep without my sleeping pills.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.629
Gosh, all I did was brush my teeth.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.029
That's fine. We can wash your salon at the hair.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.830
Wait, the salon? The hair...

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.199
Gosh.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.600
You look like the one who didn't get any sleep.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.540
Fine, I didn't sleep well. You got me.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.380
Let's go.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.649
I'll be your self-driving chauffeur.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.850
Okay.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.079
It's the same thing every time. You're always...

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.289
Hello, everyone.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.950
We're on the set of the drama.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.790
The air today,

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.289
the weather, the sun, the wind... all of it...

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.459
I just felt it would be a shame to enjoy all this on my own.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.760
Gosh.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.030
This set really lives up to the hype. Seriously.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.070
What's this?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.640
"What are you doing? Smiles?"

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.040
Seriously, doesn't he have a life? Why do they care what you're up to?

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.679
Is he unemployed?

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.209
Tell him to go volunteer or something.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.279
Come on, lay off. He's just a kid.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.920
Being curious about what I'm doing is the beginning.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.049
"Thinking of you."

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.619
Make it sound cute.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.790
Wait, were you actually thinking about him?

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.260
It's a lie.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.300
Well...

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.769
Tae Rin, so...

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.239
Is not disliking someone and liking them...

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.170
the same thing?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.269
Just because you don't dislike them doesn't mean you like them, right?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.909
Well...

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.640
So that means you're at least interested.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.449
But it's not like you to ask that. Why?

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.650
Are you asking for a friend?

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.119
Yes, well...

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.889
They're wondering if this is enough to start a relationship.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.020
So what is enough to start dating someone?

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.989
Well...

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.430
Like when your heart is 100 percent in it?

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.599
And being 100 percent in it...

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.930
How do you even know when you're there?

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.609
Gosh, I don't know who this "friend" is,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.140
but they sound super old-fashioned.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.009
At this rate, they're going to end up single for life.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.450
I guess they'll just live happily alone then.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.389
Come on, a decent personality and similar tastes are enough.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.020
Though I'll admit, I give bonus points for a good voice.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.030
But isn't it nice when someone who dumped you clings to you?

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.060
Would it be?

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.570
No, I mean...

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.470
It's not about me.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.240
I'm going to go get some air.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.850
She's cute. Seriously.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.150
(A Good Night for Reading)

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.059
- What? - You're here?

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.360
When are you going to be on TV?

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.230
Gosh, that's creepy.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.029
Seriously, how did you know filming was about to wrap up?

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.300
You said you couldn't come for now, but here you are.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.240
Did you have to get your blood drawn today?

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.610
- What did the doctors say? - The usual.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.250
It's their roundabout way of saying...

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.749
that I could drop dead at any second.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.980
Hey!

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.319
You have to play the hand you're dealt.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.090
I'm the one who's sick, not you.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.720
My whole body aches.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.499
Don't you feel like you're wasting your youth?

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.759
Day after day, it's the bookstore, the library, the flower shop.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.430
Bookstore, library, flower shop.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.140
Honestly, you act like such an old woman.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.410
- Oh, that's right, grandma. - What?

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.109
Can I go on a date here?

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.350
I told you to go out and have some fun!

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.810
What, you're bringing another freeloader...

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.250
With whom?

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.850
Someone I like.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.359
Gosh!

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.360
Hope it goes well.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.429
Thanks.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.469
You don't have to come when you have a hospital appointment.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.930
Oh, come on. Stop treating me like I'm sick.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.500
Judging by that temper, you're as lively as ever.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240
Hey.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.249
What do you think about a guy who kisses you out of the blue?

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.250
Is she pretty?

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.950
You see her all the time and you can't tell?

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.750
Oh, seriously...

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.659
Wait a minute. You did what? What's going on? What?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.060
You and the class president. Are you...

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.629
- Are you two dating? - What? No way. We're not.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.630
You're not?

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.829
Gosh, you're such a scumbag.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.200
Hey, I've never seen you ask such a tactless question.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.669
This won't do. Bring her to meet me properly.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.469
I'll have to give her a thorough inspection.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.410
Why do you get to "inspect" her? You're a bad judge of character.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.609
If not for me, you would've been...

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:20.079
Hey, I have to meet her to decide to give her free drinks until I'm 70.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.850
Oh, right. Sure.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.260
You know, you usually get a bit on edge around your check-ups.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.589
But you seem fine lately, so I'm glad.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.960
I am on edge.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.700
I need to figure out the kind of date to plan if she accepts,

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.099
and how I'll beg her to reconsider if she rejects me.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.869
Then what were you thinking when you suddenly kissed her?

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.310
I wasn't really thinking when I did it.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.310
Are you an idiot or a scumbag?

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.879
Okay, so since this is our last shoot,

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.520
we thought we'd have you write letters.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.350
To Beat and Bebop.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.719
We thought it would be a nice way to wrap things up.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.219
We'll mail you the letters you write today, one year from now.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.859
So, do you have any ideas on what to write in your letters?

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.529
- I do! - Oh, you startled me.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.930
I actually subscribe to a will-writing service.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.669
The prompts change every year, and it's sort of...

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.799
like doing a year-end review, which I find nice.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.470
Hey, writing a will?

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.910
Why on earth would you do something like that?

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.839
It's like a letter to your younger self.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.809
It's just like that.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.879
It makes you reflect on what you have left in life.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.280
Isn't that what a will does?

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.250
Beat is so trendy.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.029
- Hang on. - What now?

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.929
- Just let me see it for a second. - No way.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.030
Oh, come on. Don't be so cheap.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.769
I don't know why, but to me,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.369
you two still seem exactly the same as you were back then.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.180
We're the same age, you know.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.710
Stop acting like you're so much older than us.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.680
Bebop smiles a lot more now.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.880
And I think Beat has gotten more comfortable, too.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.619
No.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.219
How about we turn this pilot into a regular series?

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.420
- No! - No!

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.890
Just one peek.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.360
The words are just flowing for me.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.399
Look at this guy over here.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.769
- He hasn't written a single word. - Hey, cut it out.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.739
He's pathetic.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.279
Oh, for goodness' sake.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.209
Can I swear? Just a little.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.879
No, absolutely no swearing.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880
Right.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.719
Our most important project right now...

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.320
is the third part of "World of Ash." It's our tent pole.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.349
Yes, that's right,

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.089
but where have I seen this recently?

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.060
You've all read it, right? What are your thoughts?

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.230
An adaptation that took a year to write,

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.070
and this is what we get?

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.340
The co-production holds the rights, so we let them. But what is this?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.609
We shouldn't have taken it on just because it's a major production.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.180
Mr. Vice President, is it just me?

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.850
Today's going to be rough.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.860
Unfortunately, we've chosen another actor for the co-host role.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.970
And my daughter will reach out, so I hope for good feedback.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.440
That's a shame.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.380
Yes, thank you.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.220
(Bang Han Na)

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.520
What's Director Bang Han Na up to these days?

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.420
Let me know if you hear anything.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.990
We're on good enough terms to at least send some flowers, right?

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.520
Okay.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.130
It's weird not having Director Bang around.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.159
Is it just me?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.800
Yes. Just you.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.670
I see.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.440
- It gets great light. - It does, right here.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.779
Should we go with this one? There's a park nearby.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.279
It's a four-story building with no elevator.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.680
Is there a reason for that?

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.249
Are you hoping to get some exercise out of it?

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.920
Well, that was my intention.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.759
Having second thoughts now that you're here?

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.590
Well, the worrying...

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.000
started before I even got here.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160
Hey.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.730
There's a plant I don't recognise. I think it's a weed.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.870
Should I just pull it out?

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.839
How do you still have a job?

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.979
I might not for long.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.410
The recession's hit us, so work has slowed down.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.050
I might have to start hustling for business.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.919
Goodness.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.450
Seeing you like that,

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.019
it's like I'm the evil stepsister and you're Cinderella.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.829
More like the grasshopper, wouldn't you say?

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.830
And by the way, that plant you were about to pull?

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.429
It has always been right here with you.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.430
Right.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.539
"The Ant and the Grasshopper."

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.099
Gosh, I hate bugs.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.500
Let's just stick with Cinderella.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.440
Fine.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.340
Hey.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.080
That thing hasn't died yet.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.680
You got that for the grand opening, right? Has it been three years?

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.280
Oh, you're right.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.390
It was struggling for a while, but I guess I don't have to worry.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.960
I guess I have a green thumb.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.559
That's because I came over every time you said it was dying.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.800
You do not have a green thumb.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.730
- Come on, get out of there. - Gosh.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.099
You told me to let you know if anything was wrong with it.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.039
When you sold it to me, you said it was your problem child.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.139
You've got it backwards.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.179
It became my problem child after I sold it to you.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.880
Adversity makes the bloom all the more beautiful.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.949
Still, seeing it grow so well, I do feel a certain fondness for it.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:59.320
Both this plant and you.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.150
Seriously.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.919
Oh, this one's dead.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.519
I have to cut this whole part off. Hey, hand me those scissors.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.530
Here.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.760
Goodness.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.870
This is Kim Seok Ju.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.200
Oh, the poor thing.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.940
Who are you? The new gardener?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.960
Hello.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.730
What happened to the last guy?

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.270
He was so meticulous and good at his job.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.539
Brother, stop pulling weeds.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.740
You're driving.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.080
- Mom. - Why do you call him your brother?

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.049
He's your husband's son.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.749
Then why is my husband's son over here pulling weeds?

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.949
Your son told me to.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.020
So, you just do whatever you're told to do?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.249
Why would you make him do something like this?

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.790
He's better at it than I am.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.459
What are you doing home at this hour?

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.929
I was in a foul mood, so I came home to cheer up,

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.200
and now it's completely ruined.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.830
I was about to go for a nice drive with Chan, but...

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.270
What was that awful thing I just heard?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.340
Well, if it isn't the love of the century.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.410
Right.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.780
Pay up.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.050
Okay.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520
Hold on.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.520
Why are you asking for money?

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.589
"Sunwoo Hae, hereinafter Party B,"

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.359
"in return for care of his sister, Eun Nu Ri, during his service..."

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.129
"by Kim Seok Joo, Party A, who cared for her sincerely..."

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.830
"will serve Party A until he is satisfied."

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.239
When will you be satisfied?

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.939
"In the event of a breach, Party B shall live with Party A."

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.709
Then let's live together.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:05.710
Gosh.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.379
I even put my degree on hold for you back then.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.680
- To look after the kid. - Hey.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.320
You dropped everything and flew home when I asked you to babysit.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.919
And you were bawling when I brought her back. Unbelievable.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.319
Aren't you grateful? I even let you work in my shop.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.129
It's my shop. You just put up the money.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.230
- You're a strange one. - That'll cost extra.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.030
I didn't know Mom was coming either.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
I'm serious, I swear.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.310
It's just...

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.480
While your mom and that guy are all lovey-dovey, I'm...

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.220
Whatever, it's my fault.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.750
You're right, it is your fault. So why are you trying to rip me off?

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.789
Give me a ride to the office.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.760
I didn't bring my car. Take the bus.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.289
I left you that car to use it. Why aren't you using it?

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.400
Hey, let go of me!

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.700
Yes, hello?

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.300
Yes.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.009
This is Sunwoo Hae.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:11.270
We found something unusual in your blood work.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.740
We'd like you to come in for some further testing.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.250
I see.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:19.250
Why is that?

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.580
I'm perfectly healthy.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.890
I've never had any health problems.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.390
How long will the tests take?

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.000
It's just, I have to open my shop, even if I'm late.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.430
My shop.

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:51.820
Okay.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.260
One, two, three, four.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.550
I've brought you a little bribe.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.960
Use these if you get hurt.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.470
I miss you.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.979
I'll head in first.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.010
- Goodbye. - Bye.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.080
(Sunwoo Hae)

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.319
Sung Je Yeon, you don't need the company car today, do you?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.650
- Can I get the keys? - Yes, of course.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.660
Watching So Min's movie?

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.059
Eat before you go. The movie's long.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.559
Oh, yes. It's for monitoring.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.230
Isn't that your phone buzzing? You're not going to answer it?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.029
I guess the time has come.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.730
Whatever it is, you should answer. I'm off.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.000
- All right, take care. - Bye.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:25.980
Gosh.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.380
Hello?

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.350
Hey, what are you up to?

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.650
I'm in the middle of a thing. What's up?

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.590
I miss you.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320
I see.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.820
What?

00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:43.230
I still have your appearance contract. The one I signed.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.990
Aren't you going to come get it?

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400
No.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.170
I'll come get it.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.900
Well...

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.269
I'll just send it over with a courier...

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.870
Text me the place to meet.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.740
He...

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.110
Hello?

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.080
What was that?

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.290
You miss...

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.990
me?

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:38.980
Sung Je Yeon.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.820
Play it cool.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.459
- Did you take a cab? - Play it cool.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.629
- What? - What?

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.930
- What? - Yes.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.959
So...

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.170
What about you?

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.730
Cab? Car?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.640
No, I only drive when I absolutely have to.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.310
Like when I have a lot of stuff.

00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:05.679
You should've just gotten a truck, then.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.240
Why buy an import then?

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.910
Tell me about it.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.520
Why would someone without a license even buy a car in the first place?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.019
Are you talking to yourself?

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.020
Well...

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:19.889
It's not my car.

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:23.460
Who in their right mind would let someone else drive their car?

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.100
- Kim Seok Joo. - I see.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.570
- That explains everything. - Yes.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.470
So...

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.439
Where's that contract?

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.640
You mean, "Hand it over and get lost?"

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.940
No, it's just...

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.109
I have a movie to catch.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.809
If I miss it, I'll have to catch the first show tomorrow morning.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.010
I guess we have no choice, then.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.350
I'll give it to you after the movie.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120
What?

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.820
What?

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.419
Oh, here we are.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.230
How do you come without a paper ticket?

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.999
- What? - What?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.630
When was the last time you went to the movies?

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.130
I don't remember.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.240
Gosh, it's really been a while.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.979
Enjoy the movie.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.920
Yes, you too.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.220
It's starting.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:41.940
Here.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.250
A junior colleague of mine...

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.290
told me as she was quitting...

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.620
that she couldn't follow in my footsteps.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.129
Okay.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.690
She said she was quitting because I scared her.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:05.300
I see.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:09.069
So I came home to see you, but I found your son instead.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.300
- Isn't this funny? - Oh, yes, hilarious.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.970
What? Hae was at our house?

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:17.139
That's impossible. How could he have gotten in?

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.979
Seok Joo must have let him in to be his little gofer.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.239
I see.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.710
So they're still seeing each other.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.920
What in the world is going on between them?

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.450
Are they dating?

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.750
What kind of messed-up family are they trying to create?

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.120
Over my dead body.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.729
That boy, Hae.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.460
I'm not asking you to like him.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.230
Just please don't hate him so much.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.040
You never know.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.770
If he were more like you, I might have liked him.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.940
Gosh, I don't know.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.780
I don't get this feeling.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.519
What are these seasoned greens? They're delicious.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.360
You love having greens with your drink, right?

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.620
Good thing I made them ahead of time.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:15.900
- Cheers. - Cheers.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.070
(Palgakdo)

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.340
Cheers.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.840
Cheers.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.480
Oh, it's burning.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.110
It's cooked perfectly.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.820
How was the movie?

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.050
One of our actors is in it, so I'm a little curious.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.520
It's delicious.

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.590
Well, you want me to be honest?

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.330
No.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.599
Because I'm stumped on what feedback to give, too.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.470
Oh, did you read the novel draft? What did you think?

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.810
Want me to be honest?

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.270
No.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.740
Soften the blow.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.640
She's really sensitive right now. She could get her feelings hurt.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.320
Earlier, when you were watching...

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.919
the scenes with the child actors,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.790
you seemed really focused.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.190
Brought back old memories?

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.060
It was R-rated, wasn't it?

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.330
So even after they filmed the movie,

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.630
I realised they wouldn't get to watch it.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.769
You know...

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.040
to be honest,

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.110
that kind of thing really used to upset me.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.610
They made us hold ice in our mouths so our breath wouldn't show.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:36.180
I was just a kid.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.780
And after all the crying, the water, and all they put me through...

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.720
In the end, I couldn't even watch it.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.690
I felt this when you were filming with Tae Rin too.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.960
You seem to remember everything from your childhood.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.430
But for some reason,

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.200
you just don't remember what I did.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.170
Or rather, what you did to me. You don't remember that at all.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.140
Sung Je Yeon, this is in place of your speech lessons.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.609
Apparently, all the kids on TV train here.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.049
- Gosh, it's Sunwoo Hae! - Sunwoo Hae!

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.480
Isn't he Bebop?

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.420
Oh, you're here.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.719
- Oh, ma'am, you made it. - Hello.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.760
- How is your husband? - Oh, he's doing great.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.089
Hae, you should say hi to your friend.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.090
Hi.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.400
- Just a moment... - Oh, yes.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.329
Your name is Hae?

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.340
I've seen you on TV.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.270
Hey!

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.310
Why did you throw that away?

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.249
I saved up my allowance to send you that.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.579
Because I don't need it.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.980
And we're not friends.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.820
That acting academy you went to when you were a child actor.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.920
I went there too. My mom made me.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.859
- You were there? - Yes.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.159
You've got to be kidding.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.430
Gosh.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.160
You really don't remember?

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.699
Then again,

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.500
you were a pretty big deal back then.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.140
- For real? - Why would I lie about that?

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.340
I'm so sorry.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.510
But honestly, my memory of that time is a blur.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.449
I was in and out of the hospital, so I was a mess.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.789
You've always got some kind of sob story.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:24.720
It's too scary to talk to you now.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.590
The hospital? What for?

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.560
A shrink?

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:31.990
That, and other things.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.200
I was having some health problems.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.070
So I was seeing many doctors.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:37.930
Goodness.

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.400
You went through a lot at such a young age.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.369
- Are you okay now? - Yes.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.980
Oh, did your blood draw go okay?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.150
Took you long enough to ask.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.290
And what if I'm not?

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.160
You're not okay?

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.990
And if I am?

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.860
Well, then you just have to keep on living well.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.110
So what was I like? The me you remember?

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.010
My diary entry from then said,

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.920
"Sunwoo Hae was a total scumbag to me today."

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.089
"The Children's Day bouquet I bought with my allowance."

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.620
"He shoved it in the trash can."

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.059
Why on earth did I do that?

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.089
That's so not like me.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.600
Oh, it was totally like you.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.930
The more I talk about it, the angrier I get.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.370
Okay.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:46.670
Want to take it out on me now?

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.100
I can take it.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.369
And where exactly are you going to take it?

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.409
The face? The chest?

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:53.539
The stomach? The solar plexus?

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.040
Just say the word, okay?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.650
My lips.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760
What?

00:38:06.761 --> 00:38:08.260
- Think that'll work? - What will?

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.530
Hey, wait. Hold on a second.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.430
How about you just go for the stomach?

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.300
Don't be such a baby.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.970
I wasn't even trying.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.810
I still don't get why I did that.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.110
I mean,

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.010
it's just so not like me.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.420
And what exactly is "like you?"

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.490
I guess the you from back then must have been under so much stress.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.930
I was watching the child actors today.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.130
And I really don't think I could put my own kid through that.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.470
What?

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.869
You're ridiculous.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.610
Such a drama queen.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.120
What's this?

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.280
You brought your car?

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:10.819
I thought you only drive when you have to.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.160
I figured I'd need it to take you home.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.160
Let's just get in.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.859
You can at least pretend to be asleep.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.170
I'll play along.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.030
Sung Je Yeon.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.900
Wait a second.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.940
Here.

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.130
I've never bought flowers for anyone before.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:29.770
Look, I know...

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.900
this doesn't make up for the fact that I threw yours out.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.240
Let's just call this my apology.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.480
Besides, you gave me a hug that one time.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.880
We might not be able to erase the past,

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.650
but from now on, all I'll think about is you hugging me.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.520
I'm sorry I threw away your bouquet.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.159
Back then,

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.390
I wasn't in the right head space to accept such a kind gesture.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.830
I don't know how you remember yourself,

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.400
but you were so radiant.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.210
Aside from you being a pain in the neck.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240
Gosh.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.309
You're using the past tense.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:16.010
So did you.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.809
What?

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.820
You...

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.790
I thought you were asleep.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.050
I'm not made of stone, you know.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.100
There were a lot of days I went to school just hoping to see you.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.940
I thought I might get to see you a few more times.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.970
That was a big reason I agreed to do the show.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.880
I'd forgotten for way too long...

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.250
what it feels like when you really like someone.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:05.060
Do you want to go out with me if you're not seeing anyone?

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.370
So it's finally happened.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.879
Wait, you...

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.880
Why are you laughing again?

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.150
You're the one who made me laugh.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.290
Four.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.589
We pretend this never happened and go back to the way things were.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:36.929
Hey, how can you just pretend like it never happened?

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.659
- You've got some nerve. - That's not what I mean.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.060
I'm not saying we should erase it entirely.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.870
Most people seem to get together if their personalities match,

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.040
and it seems to work out for them.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.670
But I guess I'm just not built that way.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280
I'm sorry.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:05.590
Okay.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.520
I get it.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.789
Those flowers.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.830
Make sure to change the water once a day, all right?

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.430
All right, I'm heading out. Go on inside.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.040
Bye.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.980
Darn it.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.410
Hey, Sunwoo Hae!

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.920
Well...

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.930
Stick to the well-lit streets.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.440
If you feel bad, just do one thing for me.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.080
Just like we are now,

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.950
being Friend Number 1 or Classmate Number 1 is enough.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.580
But...

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:11.020
Friend Number Two is not an option.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:13.490
Make me number one in whatever we are.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:17.960
I'm really leaving now.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:52.130
What was I thinking?

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.500
The 19-year-old you...

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.570
was like a protruding stone.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:08.510
You rose up and tripped me up anytime.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.020
And I would always let myself fall.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:16.990
And whenever I stumbled like that,

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.160
I could get through another few days.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:26.230
Some light...

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.100
can get in through the cracks.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.880
And through those cracks,

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.050
light may one day find its way in.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.249
I think this is probably all cooked, right?

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.159
And you're the one who likes it well-done.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.160
True.

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:28.990
Want me to pour you a glass?

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.500
Gosh.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:37.200
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.340
- Gosh. - It's sweet.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.039
On the battlefield,

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.849
I get why soldiers packed so much alcohol.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.549
This must've been the only way they could endure it.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.780
This last battlefield.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.720
Everywhere we went was left in utter ruins.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.720
You've been through a lot.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:03.429
- You had it tougher. - No.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:07.560
A part of me wants to whine and beg you to be my partner always.

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.010
What if we...

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.110
quit our jobs together?

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.450
If you ever need to talk something over,

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.280
you can always come to me.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.089
No matter where you end up,

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.190
I'll always be on your side. You know that, right?

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:35.190
I know.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.200
Gosh. Look at it come down.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:45.770
So, straight home?

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.070
Just drop off me at the office.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.709
Besides, you have to return the car anyway.

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:55.539
Taking you all the way home is part of my job.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.750
Especially since it's raining.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.650
It's not like I'm the only one getting rained on.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:03.489
Don't worry about me today. Let's just go our separate ways.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.689
All right, fine.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:07.960
Besides, I have to file my expense reports anyway.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.089
Aren't you cold?

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.330
No, I'm fine.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.500
My gosh.

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:21.200
You're the last person I wanted to run into.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.369
What's this? Cramming for an exam?

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:25.740
I may not be inheriting the company, but I still have to study.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.439
Hey, you!

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.039
Go smoke somewhere else, not on the rooftop.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.279
I would have, if you hadn't said that.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.779
Don't start with me.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.150
I'm not in the mood for it.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.849
I'm already a mess. Do you have to add to it?

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:38.950
Why are you a mess?

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.690
Because I just want to stop thinking.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.659
So just stop messing with me.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.289
You're the one who thinks I'm messing around.

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:46.629
You've got to be kidding me.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.960
If it's so funny, then why don't you laugh?

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.300
Hey.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.080
If she seems really drunk, you take her home.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.780
Well, better you than a total stranger, right?

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:06.380
And don't get any funny ideas, you hear?

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.400
Hello.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:28.570
Hi.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.180
Do you have a cigarette by any chance?

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:37.750
Could I have one?

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.320
- Got a light? - That too.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.490
(CEO Kim Pil Du)

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:21.090
Yes, ma'am.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.560
Oh, I'm just eating by myself.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:27.959
If I go to the cafeteria, everyone stares at me.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.560
Oh, dear, that won't do.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.529
Should I ask my son to look out for you?

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:33.639
He goes to your school.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.040
Oh, no. It's all right.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:36.770
I prefer it this way.

00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:40.080
Yes, thank you, though.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:46.820
This is a school-wide announcement.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:49.680
Voting for the new casual uniforms will begin next week.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:51.950
Please check the school's bulletin board.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:59.859
The school book report competition starts today.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.499
He has a really nice voice.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.100
For more information, please contact the library club.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:06.939
And now for our quote of the day.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.070
"The darkest hour is just before the dawn."

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.709
That's dangerous!

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:16.809
What do you think you're doing?

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:18.879
Tell me about it.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.350
My life flashed before my eyes.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.120
What?

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.990
Mo Tae Rin?

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.660
Hello.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:29.160
Hello.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.090
Sung Je Yeon?

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.600
Yes.

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.940
I need you to wear casual outfits for the entire promotional period.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.269
One grade per day, for three days.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.439
I'm going to get the other outfits for the fitting,

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.740
so please wait here for a moment.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.619
You're not supposed to be in here.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.280
Move aside. I'm closing the door.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.289
Hey, I said move!

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:59.620
Go back to class! Get back to your classroom!

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:06.090
Hello.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.660
That voice...

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:11.400
Should we sit for a bit?

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:13.699
The chair looks sturdy enough.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:14.800
Well...

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.210
What, are you going to sit in mid air?

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.380
You have an amazing voice.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:28.819
Can you talk a bit longer?

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.750
How can I possibly say that any longer?

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:35.620
"In mid..."

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.530
"air?"

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.300
What was that? You're so weird.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.129
I guess I am.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:45.670
I really am weird.

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:51.369
Are you all right being here by yourself?

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.040
Is there a reason I can't be?

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.679
I ran into the person looking after you.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.279
They seemed a little worried.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.220
I guess you and my chaperone are close.

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.520
Well, your chaperone would faint if she heard you say that.

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:32.750
So? What do you think?

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.050
It's lovely.

00:53:38.051 --> 00:53:39.490
You say it's lovely without even looking.

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.340
Feeling any better?

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.340
"Today's Voice."

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:00.940
Much better.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:07.020
But that has nothing to do with my voice, does it?

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.249
Did you listen to my segment?

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.889
Yes, a few times.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:15.060
For a long time now.

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.430
For a long time?

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.399
So how are you getting home?

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.099
Did my manager ask you to give me a ride?

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.199
No. I'm asking because I'd like to give you a ride.

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.470
I'm with someone.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.270
My friend here is giving me a ride.

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.640
But I appreciate the offer.

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:41.050
My glasses.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.550
Aren't you going to give them back?

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.350
Right.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.970
Well, goodbye.

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:04.670
Your hand is cold.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:07.040
You should head home soon, too.

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:15.750
Her hands were even colder, though.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:19.650
Tae Rin.

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:21.920
This colour looks great on you.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.890
You have a stray hair here. Let me fix it for you.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:28.600
Gosh, someone else must even do that for her.

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.000
Must be because she's a celebrity.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.299
Hey everyone, your break is almost over. Go and get some rest.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.040
- Okay, we'll get going. - We'll head out.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:43.949
Why are you making things awkward?

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:45.209
- Me? - Just now.

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:46.649
You just embarrassed my friends.

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.680
Oh, they're your friends? Not your servants?

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:52.590
You know, what you just said was also incredibly insulting.

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.889
Oh, do you not have any friends?

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:57.990
And you're not embarrassed? Letting them do everything for you?

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:02.129
Well, it would be rude to refuse my friends' kindness, you know.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:05.669
And if you think I let them do it because I'm completely clueless,

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.100
that's your own prejudice speaking.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.940
You should work on that.

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.369
Where are you going? You're supposed to go back in.

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:13.710
I'm going to the bathroom!

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.310
She heard that too?

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.350
I shouldn't have said anything to Mo Tae Rin.

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:37.870
What?

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:41.370
What, you failed already?

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:43.099
Why are you talking to me again?

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.569
I just got here to take the exam.

00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:45.910
I didn't ask.

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:47.180
(Disqualified)

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:53.619
You've never had a real job, have you?

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:54.919
How did you know?

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.119
Well, I...

00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:00.049
I just got back from studying abroad, so...

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:01.719
Oh, so you have a job then?

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.659
I do. Yes, I have one.

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.929
I had to squeeze this into my schedule.

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:05.930
Shush.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:08.130
Okay, I'm going to head in now.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.230
Oh, and don't be too disappointed if I'm not here next time.

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.070
I really hope you get cut.

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.640
Gosh.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:25.110
Gosh.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:27.579
Stocks on weekdays, the lottery on weekends.

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.249
So obsessed with easy money...

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:30.889
Because it's easy money.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:33.819
I'm going to hit it big and quit this company.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.219
The goal is to quit.

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.090
Why did I get this job? To quit it!

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:39.190
So you do have a goal after all.

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:41.959
Did you get Tae Rin home okay?

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.259
How was she doing?

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.929
How can you just hand off your actress to someone else like that?

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.839
- Weren't you worried? - I was.

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.069
Tae Rin has zero patience, and you're brutally honest.

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.240
And you left someone that volatile with me?

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:55.480
Hey.

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.380
Have you moved in here or something?

00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.680
Something like that.

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.080
Hey.

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:03.819
Can you teach me how to drive?

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:07.189
Why ask me for lessons? Go to a professional instructor.

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:09.689
Oh, not lessons. I just need to practice for my road test.

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:10.989
What are you talking about?

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:13.260
I don't want to go to driving school because someone there is annoying.

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.099
You really don't have a license?

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.969
Didn't you say you only made 1,000 dollars from my stock tip last year?

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:22.099
Seriously, how can you be your age and not have a license?

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.299
How about I help you make 10,000 dollars?

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.369
It's possible to not have one, I guess.

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:25.769
So when do you want to do it? I can't today.

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:28.309
I can't either. My mom had me come here to review a contract.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:29.310
How about tomorrow?

00:58:29.311 --> 00:58:31.180
I can't tomorrow, I'm on set. How about the day after?

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:34.049
I can't. I have a blind date the day after tomorrow.

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:36.249
How about the day after that? Oh, wait, no. I can't make it then.

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:38.189
You sure you don't need driving practice?

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:40.189
You think it's okay to have no license for your blind date?

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:41.860
It's fine. I'm a great catch.

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.859
Let's figure it out after that.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:45.759
Why the blind date all of a sudden?

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.130
Did the CEO set you up?

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.730
My boss sets them up sometimes.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.399
And it's also a chance to network.

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.170
Gosh, you've got a lot on your plate.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.179
Hi, this is Yu Eun Ji.

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.479
My dad gave me your contact info, so I thought I'd text you.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.810
I was hoping we could have the session after my exams are over.

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:07.920
You have to be kidding me.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:15.419
About the session for that student we met...

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.190
- Hae! - Gosh, you scared me.

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.859
- You're back? - Here, let me get that.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.100
Oh, thanks.

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:22.660
Gosh.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.669
Guess these flowers didn't sell as well today.

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:25.670
Yes.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.599
Hey, what kind of response should I send?

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.970
Don't worry about how to phrase it. Just try to keep your phone on you.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:35.009
What would you know?

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:36.279
And you do?

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.750
The feeling of getting flowers on just a random day.

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:41.379
A day that was just any other day...

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.219
becomes a special one.

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:44.719
Gosh.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.250
That's beautiful.

00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:48.719
You should be the writer.

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.590
Hey, now you're just flattering me.

00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:53.189
I should use that on a customer.

00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:55.099
"A day that was just any other day..."

00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.269
- What was the rest? - Becomes a special one.

00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:59.129
"Becomes a special one."

00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:00.440
Oh, I like that.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.900
This is insulting.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440
Who sent it?

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.439
The director of "World Made of Ash."

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.150
Looks like he sent some premium pears.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:14.050
He never fails to send something.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.479
I'm just so touched I don't know what to do.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.119
He made a fortune off your novel.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.560
It bugs me when he thinks this gift makes everything okay.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.420
Especially since you quit writing after the movie was such a hit.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.660
Who did?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.159
I quit writing?

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.160
You didn't?

01:00:29.161 --> 01:00:32.499
I guess I'll just see it as a great adaptation that was a hit.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.270
Did you really start writing just to make ends meet?

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.269
Didn't you dream of winning a Nobel Prize in Literature?

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.409
Who knew writing novels wouldn't pay the bills?

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:41.610
Flowers aren't exactly a cash cow either, but...

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.879
I don't think that's what's important in life anyway.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.379
So what I'm trying to say is,

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.150
do what you love without worrying about the money.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:49.850
That's the way to live.

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:52.489
Geon No, you're unbelievable.

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.490
Hey, I'm looking out for you.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:55.860
Lee Geon No.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.190
Lee Geon No.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.959
You go ahead and live like that.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:02.960
What?

01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:05.300
Because I'm going to focus on making money.

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.340
I wish these were cash instead.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.650
Oh, Actress Mo.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.479
Stills from the show that's about to air?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:21.480
Yes.

01:01:21.481 --> 01:01:23.049
They need some for the press release,

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.990
and they asked me to pick out a few for promotional use.

01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:29.020
This side of Tae Rin's face is prettier.

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:32.460
What? Her eyes are closed in this. It's cute, though, right?

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:34.660
Tae Rin.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.330
You know her contract with us is up at the end of this month, right?

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.800
Have you talked to her about it?

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.910
It's not like there's anything I can do.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.240
Whatever Tae Rin decides,

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.380
all I can do is cheer her on.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.920
What's been up with you?

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.890
You having a fight with your phone?

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.919
I wonder what they sent.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.560
Well, if you're curious, you should check.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.160
This one's pretty.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.860
Go with that one.

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:10.930
Do you always have to state the obvious?

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:23.710
Okay.

01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:25.810
"Okay?"

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.029
"Sleet and Fog."

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:40.030
"Waegeum."

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.200
"World Made of Ash"

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:46.900
Why didn't you check this? Pre-production started ages ago!

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:49.369
The cast from the 1st 2 films are all on board out of loyalty,

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.309
and the lead has already signed the contract.

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.010
What on earth are you going to do about this?

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.940
What were you doing this whole time with an expired license?

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.819
The team that worked on the first film.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.820
Have you tried contacting them?

01:03:06.821 --> 01:03:09.459
"World Made of Ash." Original work license expiration issue.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.759
What took you so long?

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.959
I had a meeting.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.529
Some have left for other companies, so in reality,

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.399
it's hard to hold the current team responsible.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.269
Instead of finding someone to fire,

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:21.470
just double-check that there aren't any other problems.

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.499
You have a solution, don't you, Director?

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.439
If we don't fix this, the third film gets scrapped.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.979
Look, let's just start filming,

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.739
and we can sort it out as we go, can't we?

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:31.679
The original author's been quiet so far.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.919
That's why it was familiar.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.819
If a problem comes up, well, in the end...

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.849
It's just about money, right? We can just pay them.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:39.790
Is that how you plan to recoup our investment, too?

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.190
You might as well just offer to resign in disgrace!

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:46.190
Kim Pil Du, are you out of your mind?

01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:48.130
Sorry I'm late.

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:51.000
The original publisher went bankrupt.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.199
The original's out of print,

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.699
and the contract just says "original artist."

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.809
Besides the publisher's CEO,

01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:00.040
no one had direct contact with the author.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.979
We heard there's a representative, so we're trying to track them down.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.309
We wouldn't have wasted so much time if you'd just cooperated sooner.

01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:06.509
You guys, just stay out of this.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.620
Stay out!

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.590
Well...

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.890
If the author extends the license, does that solve it?

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:21.960
The person I was looking for before because of Producer Yu Je Il...

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.069
is the same person.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:25.370
Jin Mu Yeong.

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:30.970
Right.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.839
That name does sound familiar.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.080
Yes, the original author...

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.409
His...

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:41.280
I can communicate with his representative.

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:43.549
Good job for now.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:45.750
I doubt you saw this mess coming, but...

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.219
Je Yeon, contact them right now and arrange a meeting.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:51.160
- For the earliest possible date. - Okay.

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:54.199
Draft a contract.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.269
Looking at the old contract, the license fee, the guarantee...

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:59.199
The publisher and the production ripped him off completely.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.370
Don't tell me he got ripped off...

01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:03.169
Was it an unfair contract?

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:06.239
If that were me, I'd be so insulted, I wouldn't even consider renewing.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.740
Offer double market rate for rights and a separate guarantee. Got it?

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.349
All right.

01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.280
Marketing team. So, what's the plan for the release?

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:23.760
Welcome.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.600
Hi.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:29.700
Hey.

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:31.230
Hi.

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.630
What brings you here all of a sudden?

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.710
Here, take this. It's for the shirt I ripped.

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:40.039
I got you a sturdier one.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.240
I see.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.710
- A bit late. - I knew you hadn't forgotten.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.710
Thanks.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.719
First.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.319
A work-related favour.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.359
Second, a personal one.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.459
Which one do you want to hear first?

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.790
How about the urgent one first?

01:05:57.890 --> 01:06:00.230
The movie "World Made of Ash," part three.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.499
The original story's rights expired, so we need the author's approval.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.700
Okay, so?

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.469
I've reviewed the draft of the contract.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:12.270
Financially, it's the best deal in the business.

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.980
If the extension doesn't go through, we'll be in serious trouble.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.409
Could you send your agent over?

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:20.750
Geon No. He's my agent.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.750
I'll send you his number.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.319
Just like that?

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.150
You're the one who reviewed it, right?

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.220
I trust you worked things out in my favour.

01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:36.329
I didn't know you had so much faith in me.

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.999
As I get older,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.200
I find that trusting people...

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.540
takes less energy than doubting them.

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:45.870
- What's number two? - Right.

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.210
Your old contract. That thing was a real piece of work.

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:52.550
It was something else.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.919
If you ever go through something like that again,

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.919
just tell me, "This is unfair. I haven't been paid or anything."

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.120
Please, just say something.

01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.960
We can complain together. It may make you feel better, right?

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:05.789
And you know how good I am at that.

01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:07.190
But to do that,

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.559
I'd have to dig up the past...

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.000
and relive it,

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:15.670
and that's even harder.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:18.410
I'm sorry.

01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:19.640
No.

01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:21.080
What for?

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.579
Oh, right. That snapdragon I gave you.

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.749
- You put them in water, right? - Yes.

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.479
Wait, do you even have a vase at home?

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:30.579
- Maybe? - What do you mean, "maybe?"

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.790
Hang on a second.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.100
Hello?

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.110
Hello, ma'am.

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.639
So...

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.679
We've heard back from the author.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.779
As you know, their agent will be coming.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.880
That's a shame.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.250
I was hoping to put a face to the name.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.390
For some reason, my eyes are killing me today.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.559
(Mo Tae Rin Documentary)

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.800
(National Siblings, Mo Tae Rin and Sunwoo Hae, Appear In Documentary)

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.500
The official news is out.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.639
That sitcom was hilarious.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.309
You were probably still in diapers back then.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.639
Come on, you can find everything on streaming services these days.

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.980
Plus, I saw Bebop in person, you know.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.220
Is Sunwoo Hae still a looker?

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.550
He was so handsome back in the day.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.819
Is he doing this show because he needs a sponsor?

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:43.119
Wait, but is Sunwoo Hae even allowed on TV?

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.459
Didn't his career end after some fraud scandal?

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:46.559
Really?

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.160
He didn't seem like the type to scam people.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.569
He seemed like such a nice person.

01:08:51.570 --> 01:08:54.169
You're so hopelessly naive.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:57.000
Just look up "Sunwoo Hae fraud case."

01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:59.970
No, you jerk. Darn it.

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.209
Oh, that's right.

01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:04.179
Did they take down that old video?

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.949
I saw it, you know. The kid didn't even cry. Stone-cold.

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:09.719
Yes, but even that seemed like an act to me.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.419
Gives you the creeps, doesn't it?

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.360
He has to know, right? That he's why his mom died.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.320
Gosh.

01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:19.360
It's all in the past.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.260
Just give it a rest.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.929
Why are you all stooping so low?

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:25.529
Excuse me? What did you just say to me?

01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:27.300
It's just so pathetic.

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:30.099
I'm getting embarrassed just listening to you.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.939
You should focus on your own career instead of minding others' business.

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.139
You can't even handle your one actress.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.609
I cut you some slack because you're a woman,

01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:38.049
so you think you can say what you want?

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.850
And what slack would that be?

01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:42.619
Because I can't recall a single instance.

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.019
What? She is completely nuts.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.389
Hey, what's gotten into you? Je Yeon, you stop it too.

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.489
- What do you mean, stop? Hey! - Just stop.

01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:52.459
Was I bad-mouthing you, or was I bad-mouthing your mother?

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.329
Why are you freaking out and making a scene?

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:58.299
Assuming things and spreading rumours, not knowing their story.

01:09:58.300 --> 01:09:59.499
That's just a low-class thing to do.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.240
- Why you little... - That's enough. Stop it.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.239
I said stop! Knock it off!

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.340
Let me go.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.910
What? Ouch!

01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:09.009
What was that?

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.409
I never had a sponsor.

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:12.510
And the fraud was committed by the jerks using my name.

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:14.950
And I'm the one who worked to pay for it.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.150
And my mom... I...

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.550
I know darn well I'm the reason she's dead.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.330
Get your hands off her, you punk.
