00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.910
[Episode 31]

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.050
Happy birthday, Father.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
May you live a long life,
full of happiness and health.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.150
Great!

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.560
Wonderful!

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.220
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank you, Father.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.310
Brother-in-Law!

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.660
Yes, you.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.910
What are you waiting for?

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.150
Give your birthday wishes.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.100
Three were prepared.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.900
One is for you.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.890
I'm afraid that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.240
mere words can't express
my sincere wishes,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.579
so I've specially prepared a gift

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.840
for the Grand General.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.480
Thank you.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.380
Bravo! Bravo!

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.630
Father!

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.500
Father!

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.160
Jin'an,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.240
protect my father!

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.010
B-Brother-in-Law...

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.360
Father!

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.450
Shuang.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.160
Arrest Jin'an!

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600
Empress Dowager Qin's secret letter

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.920
must've reached the Taijin Palace.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.950
Escort the master away.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.750
Master, you need to leave first.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.310
Our comrades are waiting outside the city.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.710
I'll cover your retreat.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.470
Why?

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.200
Why do you want to kill my father?

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.830
We'd agreed to leave Yunjing

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.600
together that day.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.290
But you used the birthday visit
as an excuse to keep me here.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600
So you planned

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.440
to kill my father

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.070
right from the beginning.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.870
I really do love you.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.420
But there are things I have to do.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.430
Then let me ask you.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.720
Everything between us—

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.230
our promises

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.840
and our love—

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.880
do they all mean nothing now?

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.050
Our meeting,

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.480
our love,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.750
our vow to live and die together,

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.280
our secret engagement—

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.080
they're all real.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.159
But my dearest kin was

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.080
killed by Li Wei himself.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.230
That is also true.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.750
My father...

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.820
My father would never kill the innocent.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.400
Who are you, really?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.500
Vengeance has its target,

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.230
and debts their debtors.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.320
Blood for blood;

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.320
I must make Li Wei pay for what he did.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.330
Although I know it's unlikely,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.690
I still want to ask you this:

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.800
Shuang,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.470
will you come with me?

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.920
Go with you?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.320
Do you expect that someday

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.390
we'll be united as husband and wife...

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.100
to turn our swords against my father?

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.820

You actually set a criminal free?

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:16.230
Guards!

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.680
Arrest Li Shuang!

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.750
The rest of you, search for him!

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.750
Bring him to me,

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.250
dead or alive.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.110
Yes sir!

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.760
Hand over Jin'an

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.590
and I'll spare your lives today.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.710
If we were afraid of death,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.470
we wouldn't have ambushed
Taijin's Grand General in his residence.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.320
Since you persist in your idiocy,

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.690
you all deserve to die.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.590
Attack!

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.010
Wang,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.320
leave with Wei.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.200
Escort Prince Annan

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.350
back to the city.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.430
Cut the crap.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.840
If we leave, we leave together.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.230
I won't leave you here to die.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.920
Our lives are

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.320
devoted to protecting Prince Annan.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.790
If he can't return safely,

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.820
our comrades will have died in vain.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.850
Remember:

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.360
you must get out alive!

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.550
Let's be comrades again in the next life.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:23.830
After them!

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.090
Don't let them escape!

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.680
[Prince Annan,]

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.310
[Taijin forces have ambushed the valley.]

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.670
[What should we do?]

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.760
[Then I'll have to cross the valley]

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.640
[and head straight for Lucheng.]

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:54.400
Prince Annan.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.200
You're awake.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.590
Take it easy.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.990
You're injured.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.860
You should just rest well.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.560
Don't worry, Prince Annan.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.160
This place is

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.760
within Yao State territory.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.040
This inn,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.870
inside and out,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.270
is staffed by our own men.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.960
You may focus on recuperating.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.560
How's the battle in Lucheng?

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.450
Where's my brother?

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.790
Prince Annan?

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.670
Prince Annan.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.870
Are you okay?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.040
The Battle of Lucheng ended a year ago.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.300
Our army was defeated.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.110
Moreover,

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.140
His Majesty was

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.680
assassinated long ago.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.280
What the hell are you saying?

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:52.990
Prince Annan,

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.400
don't you remember anything?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.040
This past year,

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.630
you've been in Taijin—

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.590
A year ago,

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.200
when His Majesty
suddenly left the palace,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.590
you sensed something was off

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.990
and rushed to the rescue.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.250
But then for some unknown reason,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.630
the court suddenly announced

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.690
that you were dead.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.970
We had our doubts,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.140
so we'd been secretly investigating

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.090
until recently,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.320
when we tracked your whereabouts

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.630
in Taijin territory.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.800
But unexpectedly,

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:14.750
on our way back to court,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.370
we were hunted by Taijin people.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.300
We failed to protect you properly.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.590
Please forgive us,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.570
Prince Annan!

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.760
My brother is dead?

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.710
One year...

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.900
Why can't I remember anything
from this past year?

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.480
Prince Annan.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.920
Now, you're severely injured and weak,

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.990
and mentally exhausted.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.080
Please just rest well.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.710
In a few days,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.510
you'll surely recover.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.200
Please lie down.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.590
Here.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.880
That day, Consort Qin took my brother out.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.120
She killed him!

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.830
It is definitely fishy that
Empress Dowager Qin suddenly

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.510
took His Majesty out of the palace.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.440
And everyone present that day said

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.470
the one who assassinated His Majesty

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.080
was the Grand General of Taijin,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.920
Li Wei.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.870
Li Wei?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.370
Empress Dowager... Qin?

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.160
Wang Meng.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.870
This past year...

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.280
who reigns in Yao State?

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.560
After the late emperor

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.200
passed away,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.370
the Qin clan announced

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.800
that you'd died of sudden illness.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.430
They then placed the young prince

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.830
on the throne as Emperor.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.760
She was honored as Empress Dowager

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.630
and took full control of the court.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.280
Your former subordinates

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.720
were charged with fabricated crimes

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.400
and severely demoted.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.870
Some were killed,

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.670
and others exiled.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.660
Anyone in court who raised doubts

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.210
was punished the same way.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.470
Those...

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.240
Those loyal ministers and generals
who dared to speak up

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.240
have mostly been eliminated by her.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.310
In this court,

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.880
someone wants us dead.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.960
Yet we are

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.560
still alive.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.030
In that case,

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.880
let's send them a grand gift.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.380
Let's return to court.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.290
Yes, Prince Annan.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.350
Yes, Prince Annan!

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.550
Our state has voluntarily ceded

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.270
our Qingchuan and Helan cities,

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.160
signifying our utmost sincerity.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.750
How can Taijin

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.230
be so unreasonable and demanding?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.750
My dear ministers,

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.730
do you have
any other brilliant strategies?

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.070
Ceding territory for peace was
already a disgrace to our Yao State.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.440
The audacity of Taijin to be so arrogant.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.640
Our only option now is

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.400
to tear up the peace agreement

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.410
to restore the people's faith.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.230
Does Your Majesty

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:04.310
mean

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.310
you're abandoning those soldiers?

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.030
They've become prisoners of war,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.360
which means they should've
long become martyrs.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.840
Clinging to life

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.310
only brings shame to our nation

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.640
and disgrace to our wise ruler.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.230
The late emperor
loved his people like his own.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.470
When Prince Annan was around,

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.440
he never committed the sin

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.510
of disregarding the captives' lives.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.440
Your Majesty's strategy

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.040
seems to be using the Taijin Emperor
to wipe out

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.570
Prince Annan's former subordinates.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.620
During the Battle of Lucheng,

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.200
Duan Aodeng, as the commander,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.050
abandoned the battlefield
without authorization,

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.580
resulting in our army's
devastating defeat.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.270
To preserve
the imperial family's reputation,

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.030
I refrained from displaying his corpse
as punishment for his crimes.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.750
Even if his subordinates

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.400
survive to return,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.700
they can't escape the death penalty.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.840
So, Your Majesty,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.680
do you intend to punish me as well?

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.030
It's been a year since we last met.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:53.960
Do you all

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.010
not recognize me anymore?

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.090
It's Prince Annan!

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.550
It's Prince Annan!

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.420
It's him!

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.620
It's Prince Annan!

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.790
Prince Annan has returned!

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:02.550
He's back!

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:05.990
It really is him.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.880
Prince Annan,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.120
you're still alive!

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.600
A year ago,

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.790
I was harmed by traitors

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.600
and severely wounded,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.010
barely escaping death.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.640
To avoid complications,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.420
it was announced
that I'd died from illness.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.140
Now that I've recovered,

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.510
I naturally must

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.640
return to serve the court.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.170
Prince Annan's safe return

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.960
is truly a blessing for Yao State.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.690
We ministers

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.270
welcome Prince Annan

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.990
back to court!

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.640
We ministers
welcome Prince Annan back to court!

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:46.640
Yu!

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.230
We ministers...

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.360
Your Majesty!

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.160
This isn't proper!

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.880
You've escaped death.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.760
Even after being away for a year,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.560
you still command everyone's loyalty.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.550
With your assistance,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.850
the late emperor's and my son

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.880
would surely pacify the realm

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.660
and be free of worries.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.150
[In loving memory of
Emperor Wencheng of Yao State]

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.400
Somebody.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.750
Here, Your Majesty.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.230
Convey my decree:

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.360
Today we rejoice at the safe return
of the Second Prince.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.620
From this day forward,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.220
he shall be reinstated

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.070
as Prince Annan.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.990
As you command, Your Majesty.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.160
No need for this pretense.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.990
You don't have to
assert your authority over me.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.520
The court's people
address me as Prince Annan

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.570
because I fought in bloody battles

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.710
and killed enemies bravely,

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:06.920
which led to

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.040
Yao State's prosperity...

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.770
and territorial expansion today.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.000
Even if you don't restore my title,

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.670
I remain an unshakeable member
of Yao's imperial family,

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.370
the one and only Prince Annan of Yao.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.200
If you hadn't taken my brother
out of the palace that day,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.680
there's no way Li Wei would've succeeded.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.550
I should kill you right now

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.000
to appease my brother's spirit.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.790
But alas...

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.920
The political situation in Yao
has just stabilized.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.490
Shaking things up now would be unwise.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.450
Besides, Yu is

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.360
my brother's flesh and blood.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.310
Having lost his father
at such a young age,

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.640
that poor child can't lose his mother too.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.840
From now on,

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.770
as long as you behave yourself,

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.000
I will

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.120
spare your life for a couple more days.

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.470
Otherwise...

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.120
you have to die.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.230
Sit.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.690
I was the one who let Jin'an go.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.750
He wounded my father,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.860
but that is our personal feud.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.910
I won't allow Your Majesty to

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.310
falsely accuse him of killing Prince Li

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.770
and execute him unjustly.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.500
Swarmed with state affairs,

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.400
Your Majesty should not
waste your time with me.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.530
General Li, you're truly forthright.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.600
If Jin'an were

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.160
half as honest as you,

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.600
he wouldn't have left Taijin alive.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:02.640
Do you know

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.030
whom you actually set free?

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:09.230
He is the younger brother
of Yao State's former ruler,

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.880
Prince Annan, Duan Aodeng!

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.930
Your Majesty rules this land

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.470
and holds power over life and death.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.270
Even if you want Jin'an dead,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.960
you shouldn't resort to
making up such an absurd story.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.680
I used to think you were

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.990
exceptionally intelligent,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.360
but faced with matters of the heart,

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.800
you're equally useless.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.160
Why do you think

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.620
he tried to assassinate the Grand General?

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.560
Because Yao State's former ruler,
Duan Aoze,

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.230
died by your father's sword.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.150
[But my dearest kin was]

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.540
[killed by Li Wei himself.]

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.960
[My father would never kill the innocent.]

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.910
[Vengeance has its target,]

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.200
[and debts their debtors.]

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.990
Blood for blood;

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.990
I must make Li Wei pay for what he did.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:28.880
What?

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.880
Have you finally understood

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.040
the grave disaster you've caused?

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.470
Back then,

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.230
so many soldiers sacrificed their lives

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.120
just for this fragile peace we have today.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.600
You've let the enemy
return to his homebase.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.200
Would he possibly stop here?

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.920
This is the result

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.600
of your lack of resoluteness.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.570
I haven't thrown you into the dungeon;

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:52.930
just house arrest.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.710
I'm giving you a chance

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.230
to redeem yourself.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.010
Time is running out.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.270
Take good care of your health.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.270
Soon, you'll lead troops into battle

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.600
to attack the Yao State.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.480
Your Majesty.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.790
Your Majesty.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.760
Your Majesty.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.760
In the several clashes with Yao State,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.670
we barely won.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.600
Our casualties were devastating,

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.000
and the people suffered.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.430
We finally have some peace and prosperity,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.320
and Yao State is seeking peace.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.840
Why not take this opportunity

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.170
to put an end to this war?

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.370
General Li, have you lost your mind?

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.900
You care about the people;

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.510
I do too.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.530
The former emperor was incompetent,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.250
and Prince Li was cruel.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.400
Only I can

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.920
preserve the lasting peace
for the people of Taijin.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.400
Duan Aodeng is a ferocious warrior.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.530
Even your father couldn't defeat him
at his strongest.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.360
The Battle of Lucheng

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.120
crippled the Yao State.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.680
The Black Armored Army

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.750
has almost been completely disbanded.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.680
If we don't strike
while they're vulnerable,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.550
when they have

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.070
regained their strength

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.600
and rebuilt their forces,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.710
it'll truly be a disaster for Taijin.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:32.950
As your general...

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.960
I'll not fail Your Majesty's trust.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.950
I'll attack Yao State

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.500
and annihilate...

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.100
Prince Annan.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.270
[Do you know]

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.560
[whom you actually set free?]

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.790
He is the younger brother
of Yao State's former ruler,

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.510
Prince Annan,

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.600
Duan Aodeng.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.880
Do you know

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.070
who our enemy is?

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.890
He is the man in black
who helped us defeat the Yao Army,

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:58.640
Jin'an,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.280
who is also Prince Annan of Yao State,

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.560
Duan Aodeng.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.840
You can't forget his past kindness.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:08.720
But personal gratitude

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.900
can't outweigh national vengeance!

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:14.470
Capture and execute him.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.470
Show no mercy!

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.440
Understood?

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:19.360
Understood!

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.680
Understood?

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.790
Understood!

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.840
Move out!

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.610
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.070
Kill! Kill! Kill!

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:40.030
Kill!

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.750
Your Majesties,

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.680
[Chongzheng Hall]

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.360
we've received

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.470
news from the border.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.310
Taijin has mobilized its army.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.960
Within 5 days,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.600
they will

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.860
reach Qingchuan City.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.510
The situation is critical.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.680
Your Majesties,

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.500
a decision to fight or to negotiate
must be made.

00:31:57.030 --> 00:31:58.490
What does everyone think?

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.750
Your Majesties,

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.120
Taijin is coming in full force

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.160
this time.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.230
Our army has been severely weakened

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.470
after suffering heavy casualties

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.550
in the battles at Lucheng.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.440
I believe we should

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.840
reopen peace negotiations

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.310
to avoid more bloodshed.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.660
That is too naive.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:15.030
Previous peace talks have failed.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.270
Bringing it up again

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.770
would not only damage Yao's dignity,

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.710
but it's also

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.240
unlikely that Taijin would agree.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.160
Instead...

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.030
Please order an evacuation

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.960
to leave Qingchuan empty, Your Majesty.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:29.710
Then,

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.120
our people will be safe,

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.270
while Taijin will get the city

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.790
and withdraw their troops.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.390
It's the best of both worlds.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.280
Prince Annan, why are you laughing?

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.680
Surrendering before fighting?

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.940
Isn't that ludicrous?

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.750
Since they've started this war,

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.840
how could they be content with
such a small gesture of weakness?

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.880
This battle

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.140
must be fought.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.200
You make it sound so easy, Prince Annan.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.400
If we hadn't lost the Battle of Lucheng,

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.210
we wouldn't be
in such a passive position now.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.200
What was lost on the battlefield

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.290
must be reclaimed on the battlefield.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.640
Your Majesty,

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.440
I request to personally lead the army

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.100
and vow to drive Taijin forces

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.710
back beyond our borders.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.790
I wish to

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.960
follow Prince Annan into battle.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.970
I second the motion.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:31.470
I wish to join Prince Annan!

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.160
I wish to join as well.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.920
I wish to

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.180
follow Prince Annan into battle as well.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:37.880
Me too!

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.100
This is a grave matter.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.920
If anything goes wrong,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.090
could you bear the consequences?

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.960
I hereby make a military pledge:

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.460
If we lose this battle,

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.400
I'll offer my head.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.330
Your Highness is

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:03.970
truly a valiant warrior.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.970
Then, as you've proposed,

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.360
I appoint you General of the Cavalry

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.659
to lead troops against the enemy.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.260
As you command,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.760
Your Majesty.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:48.980
Prince Annan.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.140
Is that woman

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.770
the female general from Taijin,

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:08.480
Li Shuang?

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320
Yes, Prince Annan,

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.250
that is correct.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.600
However, her father is

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.880
the General of Cavalry of Taijin,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.010
Li Wei.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.190
The Li family owes Yao a blood debt.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.950
It's time they repay it today.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.810
[Jin'an.]

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.940
I'm Prince Annan of Yao State,

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.270
Duan Aodeng.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.700
When you're in the depths of hell,

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.370
don't forget my name.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.800
Have you really forgotten everything?

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.030
Forget?

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.000
National and familial grudges

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.950
can never be forgotten.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.950
If that's the case,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.780
everything from the past,

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.510
be it love or hatred,

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.570
ends here.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.380
Prepare to die!

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.150
As the lauded female general,

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.470
is this all you've got?

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.110
The battle flag still stands;

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.640
victory is not yet decided!

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.030
[Oh no!]

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:20.890
[It's an ambush!]

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:21.640
Luo Teng,

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.400
retreat!

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.090
Retreat!

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:25.770
General!

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.720
General!

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.280
Ji Ran!

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:35.700
General!

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.510
Let's go!

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.030
Go!

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.110
General!

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:47.370
General!

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.070
Prince Annan.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.640
The Taijin Army has fled.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:08.990
Why don't we pursue them

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.520
to capture them all at once?

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.030
We have her.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200
It's enough.
