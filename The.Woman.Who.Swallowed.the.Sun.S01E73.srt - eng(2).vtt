WEBVTT

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.250
You're just getting here?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.390
Where's the chairman?

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.890
- He's taking a nap after lunch.
- Is anyone there?

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.930
Is anybody there?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.770
Chairman, what's wrong?
Are you not feeling well?

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.570
Ma'am, please send me home.
I want to go home. Please let me go.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.710
Please, calm down.
You're already home, Chairman.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.480
No, this isn't my house.
I want to go home.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.450
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going home.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.150
Chairman, please!
Can you give me a hand here?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.620
All right. Chairman, please calm down.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.980
- Calm down.
- Here.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.790
You'll feel better after you take this.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.590
- I want to go home.
- Please take your medicine. Please...

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.060
- I want to go home.
- No, this is your house.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.390
- Please, don't be like this.
- No, this isn't my house!

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.230
First, we need to confirm
if it's actually dementia,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.570
and our next steps will depend
on what we find out.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.040
Actually, I was just talking
to Lucia about that,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.440
and if by some chance Min Doo Sik
is actually declared legally incompetent,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.680
we can't just sit on our hands, can we?

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.180
What's urgent is stopping Min Kyung Chae
from becoming the next chairman.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.490
I'll call you back.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.890
Okay.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.590
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.230
How's the chairman doing?

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.030
The chairman? What about him?
Who told you? That my father has demen...

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.940
No matter how much you try to hide it,
anyone paying attention already knows.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.570
Besides, do you know how much you've been
letting on without even knowing it?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.910
I have? When did I ever do that?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.180
That's not what's important right now.
So, how is the chairman?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.480
My father is fine,
so don't you worry about it.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.650
Kyung Chae wants to send him
to a nursing home...

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.590
Anyway, he's fine at home, so stop asking.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660
If you go around shooting your mouth off
about this,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.730
I swear I won't let it slide.
I'll grab you by the throat! Got that?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.940
Sending him to a nursing home?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.150
I've selected a few places
outside the city...

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.020
where visitation is impossible
without a guardian's consent.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.890
And we can have him admitted at any time?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.560
Of course.
They ensure anonymity and are cut off,

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.900
so total confidentiality is assured.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.100
Pick a place where no one
can see Father...

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.670
or discharge him without my permission.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.270
On top of that, it has to be a place...

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.970
so locked down
that the only way out is in a body bag.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.980
The problem, then, is when
to have him admitted.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.410
We have the official opinion from
his primary doctor and your consent form,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.790
and with one phone call, the nursing home
will send their people to pick him up.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.550
We have to do it when Lucia isn't around.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.890
She's his legal guardian.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.090
If she objects, there's nothing we can do.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.790
For her, the chairman is her meal ticket,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.700
so she'll cling to him for dear life.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.370
When Lucia isn't home,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.500
we'll have the people
from the nursing home take him.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.340
Once the chairman has been taken care of,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.740
does that mean your era
will finally begin?

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.410
It has to.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.710
I'll deal with Soo Jung and Ji Seop
when the time comes.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.450
But first, the chairman.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.020
Our hunch was right.
That snake Min Kyung Chae...

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.160
is scheming to put her father
in a nursing home.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.660
That's what Moon Tae Kyung told me.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.160
Legally, I'm his guardian,
so she can't do it without my consent.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.230
When she gets desperate,
she'll do anything.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.070
Don't you dare leave the house.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.270
Stick to Min Doo Sik's side
no matter what.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.440
Don't worry, I have no intention
of leaving the house.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.180
As long as I'm here, she won't be able to
take Chairman Min by force.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.780
So, Madam Jung... I mean...

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.520
You're going to make your move when that
woman isn't with the chairman, right?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.390
"Make my move" sounds a bit dramatic.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.760
But it is a big move.
Mingang is about to get a new chairman.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.560
Manager Gong, you just keep a close eye
on that woman.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:15.990
Don't worry.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.210
You're not going out?

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.180
Why? Are you hoping I'll leave?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.650
Don't you get stir-crazy
being inside all day?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.620
Don't worry about the chairman,
and feel free to run your errands.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.590
I'll keep a close eye on him.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.390
No. I'll take care of the chairman,
so if you have errands to run, go ahead.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.330
Well, then, why don't you at least
go to the grocery store?

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.700
That's not my job.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.340
That's your job.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.070
No, I just meant you could use
some fresh air.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.940
Why the sudden need for fresh air?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.410
Not unless I take the chairman with me.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.920
With the chairman?

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.480
Yes.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.990
I'm not leaving his side.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.640
If you kick me out of the house
and send the chairman to a nursing home,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.440
you think Min Kyung Chae will have it all,
don't you?

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.170
But that's never going to happen.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.410
She's glued to the chairman's side
and won't budge.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.450
- She won't budge?
- That's right.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.890
I urged her to go to the chain store,
but she wasn't having any of it.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.930
Can you believe it?
She told me to leave instead.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.160
Does she know something, or what?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.060
By the way, Ms. Kyung Chae,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.670
once the chairman's in the nursing home,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.170
it's a sure thing that you'll become
the new chairman, right?

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.570
Why do you ask?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.570
- You don't like the idea?
- Of course not!

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.910
It's just... It feels surreal.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.880
I have been waiting for so long
for the day...

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.650
you finally take over
Mingang Distribution.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.290
Then help me take the chairman's seat
even one day sooner.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.960
Keep a close eye on that woman
at the house,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.990
and call me the second anything happens.
Got it?

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:36.970
Where did she go?

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.360
I'm grateful you accepted me as a daughter
and provided for me,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.930
but was it too much to ask not to treat me
differently from your other children?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.200
I know.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.630
What my very existence meant to you,

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.200
and how you used me.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.210
That's exactly what I can't
forgive you for.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.310
That you're a calculating man
who would even exploit his own child.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.520
Min Kyung Chae is just like you, Dad.
It's horrifying.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.520
That's all the more reason
I can't let her take Mingang.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.990
The day Min Kyung Chae becomes
the new head of Mingang,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.700
I know I'll end up just like Mom.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.230
Dad, you ending up like this?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.870
You're just reaping what you sowed.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.510
Now maybe Mom in eternity...

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.940
can finally rest a little easier.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.060
What are you doing?

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.690
Getting the chairman's medicine.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.160
Do you need something?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.770
I need you to stick close
to Dad from now on.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.370
All of a sudden?

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.040
- Why?
- Shouldn't you be doing that anyway?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.270
A guardian should be with the patient.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.380
So now you're finally admitting
that I'm your father's guardian?

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.450
You and Kyung Chae raised havoc
to get me kicked out of this house.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.190
That wasn't so long ago.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.720
Why bring that up now?

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.690
So why the sudden concern
for the chairman?

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.930
Do you really have to ask?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.060
You're sharp, aren't you?

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.200
You know what Kyung Chae's up to.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.530
I don't know. And I don't want to know.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.240
So, if you want me to stay
by the chairman's side...

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.410
and watch him without lowering my guard,
just like you said...

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.580
then ask me.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.340
Politely.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.050
Fine. I'm asking.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.750
Please watch over Dad carefully.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.860
What's wrong?

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.560
I can't believe Soo Jung.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.230
She's completely backing down to Lucia,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.900
- asking her to take care of your father.
- Is that right?

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.900
I guess that makes sense.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.140
Her future depends on how well
that woman protects Father now.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.510
What?

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.640
And what does that mean?

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.380
Oh, right.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.280
Why are you against sending your father
to a nursing home?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.680
I already told you. Kyung Chae would be
the only one to benefit.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.690
Do you think Soo Jung is sucking up
to that woman because she's clueless?

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.590
We need that woman on our side for now.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.930
Because legally, she has all the power
over Father.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.630
I don't get any of this.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.240
According to Manager Gong,
Lucia is staying by Father on purpose.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.440
So she's already on to us.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.370
It seems so.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.210
But we can't just drag her away
from Father.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.150
She's a thorn in our side to the very end.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.380
Then she knows what you're planning
to do to the chairman.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.150
Maybe we could make up an excuse
and lure her out?

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.290
The way she's acting, I doubt she'll leave
the chairman's side for anything.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.460
No. That woman, Lucia...

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.730
In this situation, she won't come out.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.200
Then what do we do?

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.870
The house needs to be empty
for us to move Father.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.200
I've already made arrangements
with the nursing home,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.200
so let's figure out a way to lure Lucia
out of the house.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.350
I heard you knew the chairman was ill.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.080
That's what Ji Seop said.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.950
It's not that I knew,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.820
I just happened to find out.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.760
He was making it so obvious,
it was impossible not to notice.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.830
There's the company's image to consider,
not to mention the stock price.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.500
I'm sure you're aware
this is highly confidential information.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.130
What, you don't think I work for Mingang?

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.800
You consider yourself part of Mingang?

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.970
Funny, because that's not what I see.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.270
Are you finished?

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.940
To everyone else, you might seem like
a responsible and diligent director,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.750
but that's not what I see
in Moon Tae Kyung.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.650
Someone full of secrets, schemes,
and ulterior motives.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.320
An outsider who doesn't belong at Mingang,
not even in a hundred years.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.530
And you, Lawyer Kim.
Shall I tell you what people see in you?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.630
A fence-sitter,

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.470
playing both sides,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.730
a master of riding coattails, perhaps?

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.040
The chairman is lying sick in bed,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.370
so why is it that you look
so thrilled about it?

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.580
Fine.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.750
Go on and run your mouth.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.320
After I send Chairman Min
to the nursing home...

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.820
and CEO Min takes over Mingang,
I'll get rid of you first.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.990
At this point, I don't even care
if you're really Moon Tae Kyung or not.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.190
All that matters is that you're
on my bad side now.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.000
You never know what life will bring.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.200
Money, power... It's ultimately useless.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.170
I'm done with money, money. Okay?

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.100
It's now all about health, health...

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.740
Is this about the chairman again?

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.210
He'll get better.
He's getting the best medicine and care.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.850
What in the world are you talking about?

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.250
This isn't a cold you just get over.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.380
Once you get it, it's game over.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.750
I hear the chairman is not
doing very well.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.590
His new wife must have her hands full.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.230
His young wife must be going
through a nightmare taking care of him.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.930
That's right, the new wife.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.660
That's why I'm saying we should go
visit him while we can.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.170
There you go again.
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.900
Ja Kyung said they're swamped
and told us not to come.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.740
But how can we just ignore him like that?
We haven't seen him since his wedding.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.970
And we should say hello to his new wife.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.010
So this is really about you wanting
to see the young wife.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.950
Are you jealous he's with a woman
young enough to be his daughter?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.220
How crude. I don't even like young women.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.350
I prefer a mature woman of beauty
and intelligence.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.190
What are you talking about?
It's obvious you're green with envy.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.690
Why don't you just pray
for my swift death?

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.730
My beautiful wife,
why do you always twist what I say?

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.170
Yang Mal Sook, if you keep this up,
you won't die peacefully in your sleep.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.840
So your true colors are showing.
That's what you really want, isn't it?

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.540
For me to just drop dead
as soon as possible?

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.110
So you can marry some new, younger woman.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.440
Fine, then just die.
I'll think about it after you're dead.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.810
- Just die already. Go on, die.
- You drop dead first!

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.480
- No, you drop dead first!
- Hey, why are you two acting like this?

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.620
You should both live long, healthy lives.
You're meant to grow old together.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.660
To me, you two look like lovebirds.
I don't get why you're fighting.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.590
- Lovebirds, my foot!
- Lovebirds, my foot!

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.760
What did you need to tell me so urgently?

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.200
I checked the chairman's medical chart,
and I found something strange.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400
Strange in what way?

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.740
Doctor Kim blocked an official diagnosis
for the chairman's illness.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.240
Wait, does that mean...

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.280
So no one can officially confirm
the chairman's illness?

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.980
Exactly.
Even when his eldest daughter asked...

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.410
he gave her a doctor's note,
not an official diagnosis.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.150
But why on earth would he do that?

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.950
It's got to be one of two things.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.720
Either he didn't want word getting out
that the chairman has dementia,

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.990
- or he doesn't have it.
- Hold on.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.630
So what you're saying is...

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.660
Are you saying the chairman might not
actually have dementia?

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.300
It's a definite possibility.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.940
If an official diagnosis were issued,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.970
it could become a liability later on,
so he blocked it as a precaution?

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.310
But I just don't get it.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.550
If the chairman doesn't have dementia,
why would he be faking it?

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.920
Now that, I wouldn't know.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.960
So it's a 50-50 shot, then.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.760
Pretty much.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.200
I knew something was off.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.500
So whatever Min Doo Sik's reasons are...

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.770
we just stick to our plan, right?

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.370
Exactly.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.270
Holding Chairman Min Doo Sik
legally accountable is important,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.740
but who ends up with control of
Mingang Distribution is just as crucial.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.150
Whoever becomes Mingang's new owner,
one thing will never change.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.150
And that's the contribution
your parents made, Tae Kyung.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.650
It was your parents' new technology...

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.860
that Mingang Distribution was built on.
That's a fact.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.790
All I wanted was to reveal the injustice
done to my parents.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.290
I thought that would be enough.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.830
That's not enough.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.430
The truth must be revealed, yes,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.230
but who do you think provided the capital
that made Mingang what it is?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:35.570
If he just took over your parents' company
and used it to build his own,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.540
then it's time to return it
to its rightful owner.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.380
Its rightful owner?

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.080
Yes. The rightful owner.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.530
You finished your meal
and took your medicine.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.400
You get an A-plus for today, Chairman.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.530
Is Dad going to be like this
for the rest of his life?

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.500
Are you worried about him?

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.370
I've seen what dementia patients can be
like on TV. It's awful.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.580
Don't be so pessimistic.
Not every dementia patient is like that.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.780
Seeing Dad like this,
I have so many regrets.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.950
I can't help but think
it's because I gave him so much grief.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.150
How can you say that?
Don't blame yourself.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.590
Se Ri, your father wouldn't want you
to feel this way.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.900
He's not going to be
like this forever, is he?

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.230
That's never going to happen,
so don't worry.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.030
I won't let that happen.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.780
Hold on a second.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.950
Dad.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.220
You have to come back to your old self.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.560
I don't care if you're the scary dad
who yells and gets mad at me,

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.700
you just have to get your mind back.
Promise me, okay?

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.930
- Is that really true?
- Apparently so.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.640
Then I guess I'll have to find out
which side of that 50-50 chance is real.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.810
Exactly.
The only way now is to test him directly.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.850
So even if you happen to be alone
with Min Doo Sik,

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.920
don't let your guard down for a second.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.390
We don't know what his endgame is,

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:33.520
but if he's not suffering from dementia,
it's vital you play your part perfectly.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.430
Don't worry.
There's no way I'll blow my cover.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.430
Just give him your absolute best care.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.500
This whole thing might be...

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.800
all part of a plan.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.110
Whenever I think of Father,
I just can’t focus at work.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.540
What does Kyung Chae say?

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.950
What is there to say?
We're practically strangers these days.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.420
So you two have become enemies
over the nursing home.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.820
Actually, this is a great opportunity.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.420
You should find a way
to completely rewrite his will.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.360
The will? How could I possibly do that?

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.830
Why not?
His mind is gone, so what's the big deal?

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.200
I'm serious. He's completely lost it.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.370
This is the perfect opportunity.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.370
Well, I guess you have a point.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.010
It startled me so much I woke up.
And Mom...

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.080
What are you doing?

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.110
Talking to Dad.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.280
You're unbelievable.
It's not like he can understand a word.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.090
What if he doesn't understand?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.960
He loves it when I look him in the eye.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.330
You wouldn't get it.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.190
You little brat!

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.460
Seriously, even that little pipsqueak
is disrespecting me.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.440
See that? This is all your fault, Father.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.970
Because you always disrespected me,
Se Ri thinks she can do it too.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.280
Let's be honest,
you've always looked down on me.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.050
What kind of family on earth ignores
their perfectly capable eldest son...

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.380
and makes his daughters
the CEO and Director?

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.550
What kind of train wreck
of a family is that?

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.520
And then there's the will.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.420
Don't you think that was going too far?

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.620
Just think about it for a second! Think!

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.590
Then again, I guess you can't think.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:21.130
Anyway, with you ending up like this,
I'd say you got off easy.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.700
You should have been a better person.
And maybe taken care of me.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.610
I might as well be talking
to a brick wall.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.690
What is it?

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.960
What? Who requested what?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.100
Director Moon Tae Kyung requested
the cash flow statements...

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.240
and daily cash reports
from accounting and finance.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.870
So, did you give them to him?

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.610
Well, they're not classified documents,
and a director formally requested them,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.750
we didn't have a choice.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.650
All right. I understand.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.350
Keep reporting everything
Moon Tae Kyung does directly to me.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.450
Why on earth would he need those?

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.320
What does he think he'll accomplish
by digging into my past?

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.830
Moon Tae Kyung.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.560
What do you really think you can do to me?

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.540
Director Moon,
you must be very busy these days.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.780
And what's that supposed to mean?

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.680
Doing your actual work,
and digging around behind people's backs.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.680
- And whose past would I be digging into?
- Wouldn't you know the answer to that?

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.520
Whatever you're planning won't work,
so I'd stop wasting your energy.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.390
Whatever I'm up to,
what concern is it of yours, Lawyer Kim?

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.200
Why? Got something to hide?

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.470
Oh, right. I guess it's true what they say
about a guilty conscience.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.440
- What did you just say?
- Hey, come on, you two.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.970
Why are you at each other's throats again?
You're professionals. Act like it.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.210
Should you be acting like this
while the chairman is sick in bed?

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.250
It's confidential, but you both know
what the company is going through.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.150
But seriously,
aren't you two going too far?

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.340
What's this? It looks spoiled.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.410
I was cleaning out the fridge.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.410
I'm going to throw it out
with the food waste.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.950
This should've been thrown out ages ago.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.220
I've been so distracted since the chairman
fell ill. I must have forgotten.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.690
The chairman would have a fit if he knew.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.660
He's an extremely particular man.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.690
Oh, is he really?

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.430
He throws a fit if anything seems
even slightly off,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.800
so he makes me throw out anything
that's even close to its expiration date.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.240
Whether that man, Min Doo Sik, has
dementia or not...

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.440
is something only you can find out, Lucia.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.950
I'll throw this out for you.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.850
No, I'll do it.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.680
I've got this.
Go back to your work, Manager Gong.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.130
Chairman.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.330
Here, try some of this.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.700
It's your favorite.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.910
So maybe he doesn't have
dementia after all?

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.020
Oh my gosh, I'm so out of it.
It's gone bad. I was about to toss it.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.620
I'm so sorry, Chairman.
I don't know what I was thinking.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.960
Stop eating.
Wait here. I'll go get you some water.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.080
Chairman, here's some tea.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.750
Oh my gosh, what have I done?
I'm so sorry, Chairman.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.480
Are you okay?

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.790
You ate that spoiled food,
so I brought hot tea to help your stomach.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.630
It's hot, isn't it?

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.530
This is so upsetting.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.840
You can't tell you're eating spoiled food,
and you can't feel burns from hot water.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.640
Chairman, how could this
have happened to you?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.650
I guess it really is dementia.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.180
I'll go get you some more water.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.770
From what I saw, it really is dementia.
There's no other way to explain it.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.280
Really? So, were we wrong about him?

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.850
I think so.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.450
This is a huge problem.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.320
So what do we do now?

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:39.850
Well,

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.890
just in case, let's try one last thing.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.420
I think Tae Joo will have to be the one
to do it this time.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.330
You must get stir-crazy being
cooped up at home all day.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.030
I know I do, so I can only imagine
how you must feel.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.530
Let's go get some fresh air.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.140
Doesn't that sound nice?
I'll get everything ready.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.880
Are you enjoying yourself, Chairman?

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.210
We'll go slowly.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.520
Oh, my.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.950
There are so many nice places
close to home.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.760
Let's go for a walk all the way
around the lake.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.300
Are you up for it?

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.110
This is a nice spot.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.010
The sun feels nice.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.220
Wait here for a minute.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.390
I'm going to get you some warm citron tea.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.850
Looks like you're completely out of it.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.820
Hey, you.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.020
Look, I need some money right now.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.820
How about you lend me some?

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.330
Hey, I said I need some money.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.530
Gosh, this guy's a walking corpse.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.000
Well then, I'll just help myself.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.920
Oh my, look at all this cash.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.850
Wow, a platinum card.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.060
Today's my lucky day.
I'll put this to good use.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.000
You piece of trash!

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.530
How dare you touch me?
Do you have any idea who I am?

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.800
Wait, you're completely lucid?

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.440
I have my reasons for acting this way.
Did you really think I'd lost my mind?

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.980
You got a death wish?

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.380
Getting rid of a punk like you is easy.
So put it down and get lost while you can.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.550
I'm sorry.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.050
Here you go.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.510
Chairman.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.110
This citron tea smells wonderful.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.090
Shall we head home now?

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.180
