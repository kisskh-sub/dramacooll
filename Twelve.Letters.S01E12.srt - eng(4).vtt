Hello, Youran.

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:35.560
Rest assured.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.600
I've coordinated

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.439
the client's needs

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:38.279
with all departments.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:39.679
We'll meet the deadline.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:40.520
Come back quickly.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:41.559
Got it.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520
I'll return as soon as I finish here.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:45.599
Understood.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:46.719
Thank you.

Where are you going?

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.640
Where are you going?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.799
It can't be demolished.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.639
Dad,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.584
- what's on your mind now?
- It can't.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.439
It's late. That place is closed.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:16.519
Dad,

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:17.439
listen to me.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.879
It can't be demolished.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.639
Dad!

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.799

You...

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.840
It's so late at night.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.480
Where are you going?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.359
Why aren't you dressed warmly?

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:53.199
Dad.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.879
Come on. Put this on first.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:56.719
Quickly.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.519
Let's talk at home if something's wrong.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.880
Let's go.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.199
You silly kid.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.159
There's nothing to worry about.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.920
Dad.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.080
Let's go home.

Right away. Just a moment.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.439
Recently, Boda Trading
successfully bid for

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.800
the Shiqiao foothills plot.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.279
The area has been abandoned for long.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.839
Boda plans to establish

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:45.839

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.279
Leave.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.040
Haven't I made myself clear?

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.360
It's too risky.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.200
I can't do it.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.040
But this is your line of work.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.319
I can't trust anyone else with this.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.920
I won't do it.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.759
Wait, Li.

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.560
Name your price.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.720
Tell me how much you want.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.040
This isn't about money.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.320
Just leave.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.519
Leave now.

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.480

Li, I'm begging you.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.400
Help me.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.879
Please help me.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.320
Name your price.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.760
Name your price.

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.600
However much you need!

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.199
How much can you offer?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.759
One, two, three. Go.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.199
One, two, three. Go.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.400
Tang!

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.760
What's wrong?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560
I saw Ye Yibo.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.240
Where is he?

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.080
At the wharf.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.599
He rode his bike

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:11.800
towards Shiqiao.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.199
But I couldn't catch up.

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:14.720
Why is he back?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.079
I don't know either.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:17.679
But Tang,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.879
you need to be extra careful these days.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.079
Don't let him know you're living here.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:23.159
I'll be careful.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.039
Your hands are dirty.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.680
Are you unloading cargo tonight?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.520
Of course.

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:33.000
I'm covering extra shifts.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:35.839
Wash up and sit down to eat.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.959
I made you some soup.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.480
It looks amazing.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.319
All meat dishes.

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:49.680
I'll eat then.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.519
I want to check the mailbox
again tonight.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.720
They haven't replied for so long.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.839
I can't shake this uneasy feeling.

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.759
Tang,

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:20.279
do you think that mailbox

00:08:21.439 --> 00:08:22.279
is malfunctioning?

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:23.240
It can't be.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.959
Didn't our last letter
get sent out properly?

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.200
Here's the plan.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.879
I'll keep track of time.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.439
Around 11 PM tonight,

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:32.919
I'll wait for you
at the bookstore mailbox.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.679
I'll go there right after class.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.519
Okay.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.519
Eat slowly.

Captain Wang.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.960
Initial judgment:

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.000
The body's been drowned for ten days.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.240
He wasn't killed here.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.639
The water carried the body down

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.272
until it stopped on rocks and was found.

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:26.200
How far away
is the Shiqiao foothills area?

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.519
That's upstream.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.280

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.160
Go ahead.

Here's the thing.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.360
We recovered a body from the river.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:24.399
After verification,

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.240
we confirmed the body is him.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.840
He's dead?

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:30.039
Shen Cheng,

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.960
you're his only living relative.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.519
We need you to identify the body.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.759
When did he die?

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:39.360
Time of death
was the evening of November 8th.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.039
November 8th?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.679
The same day my mom died?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.720
Was he related to my mom's death?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.840
Did he cause it?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.159
We're investigating.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:56.320
Why did he suddenly reappear?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.440
Where'd he been?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.280
Please remain calm.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:02.240
Your mother, Ye Wanru,
reported Ye Yibo missing

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:03.919
starting in 1991.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.120
But he had remained off the radar
since then.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.840
So we've had

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.559
no information about his whereabouts.

Captain Wang,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.240
the case my mom
was involved in back in 1991,

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.840
can I see the case files?

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.080
It'll need a lot of paperwork.

00:11:29.152 --> 00:11:30.159
What'd you like to know?

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:31.960
I want to know if all current events

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.960
are connected to that incident.

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:34.759
Ye Yibo!

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.360
Ye Yibo!

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:48.960
What are you doing?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.919
Are you blind?

Tang,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840
I thought

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:35.639
we'd never meet again in this lifetime.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.200
All these years,

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:39.600
I've been looking for you.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.320
I needed to see you,

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:42.479
alive or dead.

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.200
A wretched life
beats an honorable death.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.799
I have a daughter after all.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.919
You've been doing well these years.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.279
This car isn't cheap.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:01.679
I never imagined

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:03.720
I'd ever ride in such a nice car.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.840
My illnesses might finally be cured.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.120
Where have you been?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.399
I've been hiding

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:14.000
like a rat.

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:17.639
I have a question

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.080
for you.

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:20.879
Where's

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.680
my mom?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.919
Where's my mom?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.480
It happened a long time ago.

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:44.480
What's the point of knowing now?

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:46.519
Did you kill her?

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:52.039
That's what you
told the police back then, right?

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.560
Did it work?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.799
Without a body,

00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:56.879
it didn't work at all.

00:16:58.919 --> 00:16:59.799
So it was you.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.720
I was one step too late then,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.920
letting you live these extra years.

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.799
You never believed

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.240
your mom ran off with someone, did you?

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.199
Back then,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.800
I believed you.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.240
I still believe what you're saying now.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.480
What happened

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.960
that day?

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.599
Your mom was acting strange that day.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.000
So I followed her all the way.

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:36.799
At Shiqiao,

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:38.480
I caught her.

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:42.039
I found two boat tickets on her.

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:44.920
She was planning
to run away with some man.

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.799
I told her,

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:48.680
"Whoever it is,"

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.039
"just stay with me."

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.680
"And I'll let it go."

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:53.960
But she refused.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.559
I got on my knees and begged.

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:56.680
Still she refused.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.119
That woman was heartless.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:02.160
She would rather die
than go home with me.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.519
So I kept choking her

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:07.680
until she stopped breathing.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And she still refused.

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:11.000
She was eager to run away with a man.

00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:13.640
She was desperate to leave our family.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.920
She wasn't running away.

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:20.079
The second ticket was for me.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.680
She waited at Shiqiao for me.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.160
She wasn't running away!

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.279
She was waiting for me!

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.559
So you two planned to run together.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.760
You've kept

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:51.519
the secret buried for decades,
haven't you?

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.000
Truly Wu Fengying's daughter.

00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:57.839
Both master schemers.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:00.279
You two ruined my life!

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.359
Hiding the truth all these years,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.960
you're finally confessing now.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.720
Tang,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.880
do you know
why I dare tell you this now?

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.240
Go report me now.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.079
Let the police arrest me.

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:20.440
The court won't sentence me to death.

00:19:21.559 --> 00:19:22.799
I'm old

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.480
and sick.

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:26.199
Prison means

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.839
free healthcare

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.640
and free meals.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.240
It'll be so much better

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.200
than starving out here.

00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:36.679
Tang,

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:38.440
if you can't swallow the anger,

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:40.640
I will turn myself in now.

00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:44.559
"Can't swallow"?

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:47.960
To you,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.800
can all the things

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:51.359
and the lives

00:19:52.759 --> 00:19:53.880
be "swallowed"?

00:19:58.319 --> 00:19:59.559
We're old now.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.039
Anything can be let go of.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.840
Right.

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:23.119
We're old now.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.000
It's enough.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.880
Yes.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.800
It's enough.

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:42.440
Buckle your seatbelt.

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:03.119
Where are you taking me?

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:08.440
To give you a ride.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.568
Why didn't Tang Yixun
pick you up tonight?

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:43.400
He's working at the docks.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.440
It's past 11 already.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.559
Let me walk you home.

00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:49.079
No need.

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:50.359
We'll meet at the bookstore.

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:54.039
Which college will Wang Manyu go to?

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:57.079
I'll ask about it later.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.920
Do you know what Wang Manyu likes?

00:22:05.759 --> 00:22:06.599
Are you okay?

00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:08.359
How could you ride like that?

00:22:08.359 --> 00:22:09.440
You crashed into me.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.079
Unreasonable!

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:10.960
I crashed into you?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.000
Did I touch you?

00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:13.039
Where were you going?

00:22:13.199 --> 00:22:14.039
You should've gone

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:14.799
this way.

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:15.680
You insulted me.

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:17.399
You're unreasonable.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.480
You insulted me.

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:47.440
(You don't have a mom now.)

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.839
(A woman like her)

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.839
isn't worthy to be your mom.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.080
Tang,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
from now on, it'll be

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.039
(only us in this family.)

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.440
You hit me and insulted me.

00:23:03.079 --> 00:23:04.279
Where are you going?

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.520
Ye Haitang!

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.240
Shen Cheng, you can't mail that letter.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.080
Haven't you thought?

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:24.879
If...

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.880
If we stop all this,

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:28.480
then everything afterward

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.559
could change completely.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.200
Your mom might miss your dad.

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:33.319
And you might never be born.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.080
I have.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.960
Very seriously.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.960
But recently,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.720
the more I learn about the past

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.200
and the more I understand them both,

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:04.039
the more unsettled I feel.

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.720
I've made up my mind.

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:07.480
I can't accept

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.759
my mom ending her life

00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:09.880
in that way.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.240
None of this

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.920
should require sacrificing you.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.519
You have a whole life ahead.

00:24:17.559 --> 00:24:18.559
If you were me,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.000
what would you do?

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.519
Neither of us is a hero.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.039
We're both ordinary people.

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:53.880
Being ordinary means

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.200
we can't do many things.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.519
Without that mailbox,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.759
I'd suggest we each go home,

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.119
let go of the past,

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.119
and move on with our own lives.

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:03.720
But there's no choice.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.359
That mailbox

00:25:04.359 --> 00:25:06.440
appeared right before us.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.000
We can save two young people

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.559
from their suffering.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.519
I know this might devastate you.

00:25:28.359 --> 00:25:29.759
If everything changes,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.200
you'll lose a father who loves you.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.920
You might end up

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.160
alone in this world.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.839
And I might never have existed.

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.839
We'll both lose so much.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.799
But we'll still save them.

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:50.359
No.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.520
No, Shen Cheng.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.559
We are different.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.000
You have your dad.

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:00.720
You still have family in this world.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.599
If everything changes,

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480
my dad won't have me.

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.680
I won't have a family.

00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:26.599
No one in this world will remember me.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.160
How come nobody remembers you?

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.480
I'll remember you.

00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:30.920
I'll remember all of this.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.720
I'll remember.

00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:38.759
You won't remember me.

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:51.640
That's not true.

00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:52.799
That's not true.

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:53.720
There's another way.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.559
There must be.

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:55.759
We just haven't thought of it.

00:26:55.759 --> 00:26:57.119
There might be another way,

00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:59.079
but we're out of time.

00:26:59.079 --> 00:26:59.720
My passport.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720
No, we'll figure it out.

00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:01.919
Let's think again.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.039
We can think of a way.

00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:04.200
We're running out of time.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.240
No.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.280
Keep up.

00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:17.359
The construction guys are here.

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:19.559
Look, it's them, right?

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.000
Yes.

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:28.199
Where are you going?

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:30.399
Where are you going?

00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:31.519
I need to take a look.

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.680
What if they demolish it?

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.520
Be quiet.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.279
I know their operation too well.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.079
They won't make big moves at night.

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:38.079
They're just setting up.

00:27:38.559 --> 00:27:39.400
Before dawn breaks,

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.279
I'll move the mailbox.

00:27:40.279 --> 00:27:41.039
Cut the crap.

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:42.400
How will they mail letters then?

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.400
After they finish demolishing,

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.759
I'll put it back.

00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:47.039
The mailbox matters the most.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.119
With the mailbox, they can mail letters.

00:27:49.119 --> 00:27:49.880
I'll guard it.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.119
Your plan won't work.

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:51.880
I'll talk to them.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.279
Will they listen to you?

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.119
Worth a try.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.400
Don't get yourself...

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.839
Shen Cheng texted me.

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:00.160
Quick. Help me up.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.279
On the night of November 30,

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.720
you and Tang Yixun must not
go to the foothills.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.359
Or Tang Yixun will kill someone.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.559
Then you'll never see each other again.

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.680
This might be our final correspondence.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.880
But please believe,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.440
all hardships will pass,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.079
and you'll have a bright future ahead.

00:28:17.079 --> 00:28:18.680
May you overcome adversity

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.640
and reach the stars.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.719
Yu Nian and Shen Cheng.

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:21.559
What does this mean?

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:22.480
Killing someone? Why?

00:28:23.599 --> 00:28:24.439
No idea.

00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:27.519
Quan,

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:28.720
we can't make it back in time.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.759
Time's running out.

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:31.279
We need you to send this final letter.

00:28:31.839 --> 00:28:33.000
Do it before they remove

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.160
the mailbox.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.000
Please.

00:28:35.199 --> 00:28:36.039
Send the letter.

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:36.599
Hurry.

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:37.439
Come on.

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:38.959
Hurry.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.160
It's 11:40 now.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.560
Where's the pen?

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:45.279
Who took my pen?

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:46.559
It's making this worse.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.480
I'll buy one.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.839
Where will you find one at night?

00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:49.599
Don't waste time.

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:50.799
It's already 11:40.

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:52.039
I don't have a pen.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.280
You have one?

00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:00.199
Here.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.799
What pen is this?

00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:02.640
Eyebrow pencil.

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:04.720
How do I write with this?

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.680
Stop complaining.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.799
It'll work.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.560
Time's limited.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.520
Oh my god!

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:14.400
Stop that disgusting act.

00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:24.839
What did you do?

00:29:24.839 --> 00:29:25.880
How do we write like this?

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.039
I didn't mean to.

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:27.920
You aren't helping!

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.839
How do I fix this?

00:29:28.839 --> 00:29:30.400
Too late now. What now?

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:30.839
Enough!

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:32.079
Stop yelling.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.720
There's some space left. I'll write.

00:29:35.439 --> 00:29:36.279
Look at you.

00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:38.359
Such an important matter,
and we're late.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.319
Why'd you stop?

00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:45.839
There's not enough space.

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:47.799
Write the crucial parts.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.320
About the murder.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.320
The murder.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.200
If you can't send this letter,

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.240
you'll regret it.

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:54.880
How do you feel?

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.039
I can manage. No problem.

00:29:56.039 --> 00:29:56.680
He's young.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.240
Yeah, he is.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.080
Right.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.799
What is the time now?

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.759
It's late. Go rest.

00:30:03.319 --> 00:30:04.400
You should rest too.

00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:05.359
Bye.

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:05.880
Young man,

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.000
next time, shop with me.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.720
Right.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.640
No problem. Bye.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.160
(Mom,)

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.000
why do you only
wear this same hairpin every day?

00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:45.079
What? Doesn't it look nice?

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:46.640
It does look nice,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.759
but do you only have this one?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.799
Then when you grow up,

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:52.759
buy Mom new hairpins, okay?

00:30:52.999 --> 00:30:53.839
Okay.

00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:56.200
I'll buy you a hundred hairpins.

00:30:56.759 --> 00:30:58.000
A hundred hairpins?

00:30:58.319 --> 00:30:59.599
I can't wear them all.

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:12.700
(Sunshine Bookstore)

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.160
Only five minutes left.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.680
You go first. Don't mind me.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.079
We'll make it. We will.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.800
What's going on?

00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:40.079
Why's it blocked?

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:40.759
No idea.

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:41.920
Relax, that's my buddy.

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:43.119
Let's go.

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.159
Bro.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.079
Zhang Quan, what are you doing?

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:48.680
Construction inside. No entry.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.279
Construction?

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:50.200
I'm in a hurry.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:50.960
Five minutes, okay?

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.680
No.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.520
There are rules.

00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:54.519
Don't touch her.

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:55.200
She's pregnant.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.400
She still can't pass.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.240
Zhang Quan, stop.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.559
You want to get fired?

00:31:59.719 --> 00:32:00.559
Stop.

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:01.759
Five minutes. I'll be quick.

00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:02.480
No way.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.519
I have urgent business.

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:04.480
One minute. Please.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:05.680
Now get lost.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.720
Why did you kick him?

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:09.599
Get lost.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.199
I respect you as my superior.

00:32:11.199 --> 00:32:12.039
My mom taught me

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:13.519
to keep peace when away from home.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.840
You can't do this.

00:32:14.959 --> 00:32:15.799
Your mom taught you?

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:17.559
Didn't your mom tell you I'm your dad?

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.880
I'm telling you.

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:20.440
Get out of here now!

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Captain's getting beaten!

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.960
Miaomiao!

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.000
Help hold him down.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.880
Miaomiao!

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.720
Beat him!

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:31.039
Leave this to me.

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:32.599
Quan.

00:32:32.599 --> 00:32:34.079
Go mail the letter, Miaomiao.

00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:35.279
Quan, hang in there.

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:37.959
Mail the letter.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.400
Hang in there.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.759
Hold him down.

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:52.000
Get that letter mailed!

00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:33.312
(Avoid the foothills and killing
on November 30th.)

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:38.239
Don't kill anyone?

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:39.959
Tang Yixun.

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:43.440
Isn't Ye Haitang here?

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440
Isn't she with you?

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.280
Oh no.

00:34:45.519 --> 00:34:46.719
We just finished tutoring,

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:47.480
and when we left,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.000
she said she was coming to find you.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.119
But we hadn't walked far

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:51.400
when a motorcycle crashed.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.000
Then Ye Haitang chased after it.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.039
Who was on it?

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:55.199
Not sure. It was dark.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.360
But that man was scary.

00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:57.559
Ye Haitang knows him.

00:34:57.559 --> 00:34:58.280
It's midnight.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.120
Where could she be?

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:00.439
What's today's date?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.679
Today? November 30th.

00:35:10.519 --> 00:35:11.519
Call the police.

00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:13.280
Let them go to the foothills.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.280
What are you saying?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:14.800
Stop it.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.640
Just call the police.

00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:18.880
Let them go to the foothills.

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:20.919
Okay.

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:27.959
Li.

00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:34.079
It's too windy.

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:35.039
I can't set sail.

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:35.919
Li,

00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:37.079
this thing can't wait.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.200
Handle it now.

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:40.239
I won't risk my life for you.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.239
I'll double

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.760
the promised price.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.760
Will that work?

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.880
You'd better keep this buried.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.639
Don't you drag me into this.

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:01.919
Don't worry.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.280
If something happens,

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.000
I'll be the first to die.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.600
Ye Yibo!

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.840
Who's she?

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:20.559
What's in the sack?
