00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.560
{\an8}Tomorrow at noon, I'll go live
and make a public statement.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.160
{\an8}The person in the photo is me.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.000
{\an8}Your precious daughter

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.720
{\an8}is causing more drama
for the family again.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.960
{\an8}Are you planning to stay
and drag our name down even further?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.680
{\an8}And who exactly is so disgraceful?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.880
{\an8}Can't you forgive Tawan's father?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.880
{\an8}I told you to break up with her

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.800
{\an8}because I'll never make peace with him.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.120
{\an8}If you want to love each other

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.600
{\an8}while making me miserable,
then do whatever you want.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.720
{\an8}Do you really think we can be together
if both our dads refuse to accept it?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.680
So, we'll wrap things up as agreed, Boss.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.560
I don't think
there's anything else to add.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.840
No, that's it.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.960
Alright then,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.040
we'll leave it at that.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.440
Well, Boss,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.040
the new security company
looking after Ms. Ayla and Mr. Thana is…

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.520
Boss, are you going
to see Ms. Ayla after work today?

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.520
Are you going?
I can drive you over to her place.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.680
Better not.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.880
I don't want to put Ayla in
an awkward position. I feel bad for her.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.800
Are you holding up okay, Boss?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.480
That's love, Boss.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.640
When it goes well,
smiles are there to keep you company.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.800
But when it doesn't,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.160
tears will take their place.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.400
So today, which one's keeping you company?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.160
Smiles or tears?

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.080
A mix of both.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.520
Smiles…

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.880
and tears.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.160
But that's okay.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.040
More friends
to keep me from feeling lonely.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.320
Saying that, have you already given up?

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.320
No. But I don't want to be selfish.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.800
Happy,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.960
while she and her father are suffering.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.000
Submit the bid exactly like this.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.160
Yes, sir.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.400
And what about the gunman incident?
Any progress?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.840
No progress yet, sir.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.880
Remind the new security team
to be extra careful,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.480
especially the team guarding Ayla.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.600
Understood, sir.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.040
The bid submission…
Everything's in order, right?

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.400
What's the problem?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.000
Well…

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.920
Mek.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.120
Mek.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.360
Mek!

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.240
Who? You got a death wish--

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.800
Yeah, maybe.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.120
Might scare you
into actually working for once.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.280
It's nearly noon already.
Aren't you supposed to work?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.000
Planning to sleep
until Bangkok disappears off the map?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.800
You're really testing my patience.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.720
Where's the bid submission at?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.480
I had my secretary handle it, Dad.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.960
You had your secretary handle it?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.920
This is a multi-billion-baht project,
and that's your answer?

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.240
No, I mean…

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.680
I've already
taken care of everything myself.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.800
Taken care of?

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.680
The project consultants say

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.760
you haven't even sent them
a single thing to review.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.320
Well…

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.440
I was planning to keep everything a secret
and submit the bid all at once.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.800
Mek, this tender is important.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.760
You can't keep treating it
like one of your games.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.960
How many times
have you failed to win a bid?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.000
Every single time!

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.440
You've lost so many times
that the company I've built my entire life

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.280
is about to collapse in your hands.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.360
Trust me, Dad.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Please. Just this once.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.960
This is not like any other time.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.560
I'll make you proud this time.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720
Fine.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.840
Let's see

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.160
if you make me proud

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.080
or if it's time I start rethinking
a few things about you.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.720
Why is it you never trust me?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.120
Nothing I do
is ever good enough for you, is it?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.040
Oh, right, because I'm not Tawan.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.080
Whatever she does, it's always perfect,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.320
always impressive,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.400
always makes you proud.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.240
Try blaming yourself for once,
not everyone else.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.240
And this

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.400
has nothing to do with Tawan.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.280
Of course it does!

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.120
I know you've been giving her
company documents to read.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.760
Why, Dad? You want her to take my place?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.200
Is that it?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.760
No one can replace you,

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.960
if you're good enough.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.520
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.200
What do you mean by that, Dad? Talk to me!

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.320
Damn it!

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.560
Are you really thinking of having
Ms. Tawan replace Mr. Mek?

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.440
Just a thought.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.000
If she really joins,

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.200
our company could be ranked
among the top in Asia for sure.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.040
Sorry, sir.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.680
How many tenders have we lost this year?

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.880
Five, sir.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.760
And we've lost to T.R. Develop,
Mr. Thana's company, every time.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.880
SLIDE TO ANSWER

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.600
I'll be going now.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.800
Can I speak to you frankly?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.560
- Dad--
- Let me finish first.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.560
The company's situation
isn't good right now.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.160
We've lost several major bids,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.000
and it's hurt our credibility
with the board, shareholders,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.800
and key clients.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.760
I've tried to guide Mek.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.680
I've done

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.800
everything I could,

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.360
even put the company on the line for him.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.760
But Mek is still Mek.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.160
I just can't put any hope in him.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.640
With this next big tender coming up,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.520
I'm afraid

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.360
we'll lose again.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.760
If it's that important,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.880
why don't you handle it yourself?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.520
If I do, it's like hammering
the final nail in Mek's coffin.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.920
Any shred of credibility he has
with the shareholders will be gone.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.200
And when that happens,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.840
I don't even know what the future holds

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.040
for the company I built with my own hands.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.280
And you think
I could work at your company?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.560
I'm certain you can.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.040
Let me be straightforward.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.400
The reason I hired a private bodyguard
for my daughter

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.480
was because I've been dealing
with serious business threats.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.880
I've received multiple death threats
against both me and my daughter.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.200
I don't know if what happened to Ayla

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.120
was really from anti-fans

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.880
or from my business enemies.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.040
Who's the frontrunner
for this bidding round?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.880
T.R. Develop,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.840
Thana's company.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.680
Please give us a moment here.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.520
Hello, Boss.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.720
How are you doing? Tired?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.760
Not tired.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.520
I wasn't asking about work.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.280
I meant, with your personal life.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.000
I'm exhausted…

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.560
and really discouraged.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.800
It just feels like

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.760
there are too many problems all at once.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.920
The problems of adults

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.320
becoming the problems of two young people?

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.880
Ayla,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.320
when you love someone

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.960
with all your heart,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.440
love them unconditionally,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.800
sometimes you can't explain why.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.680
And there's no such thing
as right or wrong.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.839
But everyone says it's wrong
for us to love each other.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.560
And who exactly is "everyone"?

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.960
Your two fathers?

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.200
They think it's wrong?

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.960
Because to the rest of the country,

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.319
your love is something beautiful,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.680
something right.
They're ready to support you both.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.880
See? Right and wrong

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.040
depends on perspective.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.840
It depends on who says it first

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.760
and how much influence

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.080
they have over your life,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.080
over your heart.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.680
Ayla,

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.560
every problem

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.960
has a solution.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.840
Big or small, hard or easy,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.840
happy or sad,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.560
there's always a way out.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.840
It's just a matter of choosing the one

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.080
that hurts your heart the least.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.600
Come on, little one.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.120
Don't cry over something like this.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.360
Tawan.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.280
Can we not be like this anymore?

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.320
I don't want us to go on like this.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.320
Don't cry, okay?

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.040
Don't cry.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.360
I understand everything.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.960
I really do.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:49.600
Don't cry.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.960
Does everything that's happened…

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.160
hurt you…

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.080
a lot?

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.760
It hurts me so much,

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.400
like my heart's about
to tear out of my chest.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.280
When you're not with me,
I don't want to do anything.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.160
It feels like I can't go on.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.760
Can I be selfish?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.560
I don't want to hurt my dad,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.640
but without you, I can't live.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.760
So, if he's going to be angry,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.560
then I'll just have to let him be.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.120
Just…

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.360
stay with me like this.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.760
Hold my hand and never let go.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.080
I never once thought of leaving you.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.840
My heart's been here

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.040
from the very start,

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.920
and it's going to stay here. Always.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.240
Promise?

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.560
I promise.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.160
I promise.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.320
We'll have each other

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400
until…

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.400
the very last breath of our lives.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.720
Boss, have a sandwich.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.400
Thank you.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.840
Ayla.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.440
Go get some proper rest in your room.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.240
Let's see each other tomorrow.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.560
No…

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.760
I'm not letting you go yet.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.080
Stay a little longer, please.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.480
Thanks!

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.520
So, the numbers are still the same?

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.560
Alright.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.200
Thank you.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.120
Why haven't T.R. Develop
and Park Thai pulled out yet?

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.520
Listen, if our company loses this tender,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.360
start packing your things.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.320
I'm not keeping a useless ox
on the payroll.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.600
Got it?

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.640
Got it, sir.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.000
I'll make sure it's handled.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.880
Burn this into that thick skull of yours.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.920
I don't care what tricks
you're planning to use,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.240
but I will win this bid.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.720
Yes, sir.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.600
Try being smarter than an ox for once.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.720
About that plan we talked about, go ahead.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.520
Just go ahead and do it!

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.240
Don't worry about a damn thing!

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.200
We're already at the bidding venue, right?

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.520
Yes, sir. We're on standby.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.280
Any issues?

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.600
None. We're just waiting for the opening.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.080
Good. If anything comes up, call me.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.040
Yes, sir.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.920
Give me a hug, Dad.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.440
I'm going to work now.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.200
Aren't you having breakfast first?

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.120
No time. I'm running late.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.680
I'll get going.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.880
Thanks!

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.160
Look who I've spotted!

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.200
Hello!

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.760
The one and only Ayla!
You've been on fire lately.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.040
So, how's that secret project going?
Any surprises coming up?

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.320
Well, as everyone knows,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.800
I've got a big concert coming up.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.200
It's my way of thanking the fans
for all their love.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.960
Wow, so work's keeping you busy.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.640
Can we talk a little about your love life?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.880
Sure.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.800
Many people say

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.000
they'd love to see you and Tawan
make a public appearance together.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.280
Think that could happen?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.320
Honestly, Tawan's swamped with work.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.440
Maybe once things calm down a bit.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.640
Yeah.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.160
So, she really is busy,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.400
and not just because you're keeping her
all to yourself, right? People say

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.240
they want to see
two beauties side by side.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.960
I'm not keeping her to myself.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.960
She's just really shy around cameras.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.280
- I see.
- But when she's ready,

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.520
everyone will get to see her.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.960
- Okay then, I'm booking the first queue.
- Deal.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.160
So cute, as always. Thank you so much.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.840
- Thank you, Ayla.
- Thank you.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.320
Good luck! I'm supporting you.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.880
Thanks again.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.280
Bye!

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.320
Thanks!

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.800
Ang, how was that just now?

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.920
Oh, just now?
Looked good. You can head home.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.320
- Okay. Thank you.
- Alright. Bye!

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.160
Goodbye!

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.520
Excuse me.
Ms. Tawan sent these flowers for you.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.920
Thank you.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.040
WISHING YOU A GREAT DAY AT WORK - TAWAN

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.400
The flowers are so beautiful.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.640
Do you like them?

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.240
I love them. Are you done with work yet?

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.600
Not yet.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.000
What about you? Are you finished?

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.320
Yeah, I just wrapped up,
and I'm packing up to head home.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.440
After today, I'm free.
I'll be waiting for you at home.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.240
Are you hungry? I'll cook for you.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.840
Are you going to buy me something
or actually cook?

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.120
I'll cook!

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.480
Don't underestimate me.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.680
I've improved a lot.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.360
I can make all kinds of dishes now,
even if only a few taste good.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Either way,
you have to come home and eat with me.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.560
Sure. I'll eat you.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.480
I mean dinner!

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.840
Okay.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.720
Dinner. Don't get any funny ideas.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.880
Did you see the photo I sent?

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.920
What do you want?

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.840
That day, I even aimed to miss,

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.200
and you still
wouldn't back out of the bid.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840
You…

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.640
The choice is yours, Mr. Thana.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.560
Wow, today was so chill.
I barely had to do anything.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.360
BODYGUARD

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.520
Just some insert shots

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.800
and an interview. You know, the usual.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.280
Are you with Ayla? Put her on. Now.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.160
What should we eat? I can't decide.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.080
Ms. Ayla, your father
wants to speak with you. Urgently.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.000
Tawan, I'll call you back.
See you at home. Dad's calling.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.840
Okay.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.280
Hello, Dad.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.200
Ayla!

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.200
Are you okay?

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.160
I'm fine.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.720
Miss, watch out!

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.480
Ayla! Ayla!

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.239
Give it to me!

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.920
I warned you.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:23.840
Go.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.199
Hello? Hello?

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.880
Yes, Mr. Thana?

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.520
Pull us out of the bidding. Now.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.679
Pull out?

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.639
I said withdraw from the bidding. Now.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.080
Yes, sir.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.480
Tawan!

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.400
Tawan!

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.440
Take that!

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.720
Tawan!

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.600
Put the gun down.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.800
Or I'll kill this bitch.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:58.480
Now!

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.480
Back up.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.480
Slowly.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.080
Back up.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.840
You laid a hand on my woman.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.600
You laid a hand on my woman, huh?

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.400
You laid a hand on my woman!

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.040
Boss, that's enough.
Stop or you'll kill him!

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.480
Get out!

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.640
Die!

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.080
- Die!
- Tawan! Stop! Stop!

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.520
Come here. I'm safe now.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.360
Ayla, are you hurt anywhere?

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.360
I'm fine. Not hurt at all.
You're the one who's hurt.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.040
The other side's been cleared, Boss.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.160
Good.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.560
Let's get the car ready to leave.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.360
Get the car ready.
We're going to the hospital right now.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.040
No.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.600
We have to take Ayla home first.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.720
But you're injured, Boss.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.640
She's right.
We should go to the hospital first.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.520
Your arm's badly hurt.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.080
Ayla, listen to me.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.520
You have to go home now.
Mr. Thana is waiting.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.280
Prepare the car to take Ayla home.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.120
Yes, Boss.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.720
Get the car ready.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.040
Tawan?

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.440
Why? Why won't you…

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.760
- Why won't you go--
- Trust me.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.960
Mr. Thana is waiting.
You need to go home first.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.080
Dad! Dad!

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.840
We won!

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.920
Okay.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.040
Well done.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.080
I told you we'd win this time.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.880
Good.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.840
Good.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.320
Tawan,

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.800
can we please go to the hospital first?

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.680
Please, I'm begging you.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.440
Ayla,

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.600
we can't yet.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.400
Right now, I need to take you
to the safest place first.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.120
And what's so unsafe about a hospital?

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.440
My hands are freezing.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.000
Ayla, listen.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.200
Anyone can get in and out of a hospital.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.920
I don't trust it.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.920
And if someone hurt you again,

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.680
I'd never forgive myself

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.800
for being too weak to protect you.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.040
Chanya, please tell her
to go to the hospital first.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.360
She still hasn't stopped bleeding.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.800
Ayla,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.280
focus.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.520
Listen to me.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.400
The most important thing right now
is getting you somewhere safe.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.440
This wound is nothing.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.520
I can handle it. Trust me.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.440
Don't cry, okay?

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.080
No more tears.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.560
- Don't cry.
- Okay.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.000
That's my girl.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.240
{\an8}I'm making you
vice president of our company.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.560
{\an8}You mean it, Dad?

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.840
{\an8}Keep your eyes on everyone
in the Chokprasertsap family.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.560
{\an8}That's your old family name, isn't it?

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.520
{\an8}These are the names of the suspects
and several persons of interest.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.920
{\an8}And if what you're thinking
turns out to be true,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.440
{\an8}what will you do?

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.560
{\an8}Then it'll be to the death.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.720
{\an8}He can hurt me, and I'll take it.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.400
{\an8}But if he hurts you,
the person I love most,

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.720
{\an8}I will never forgive him.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.440
