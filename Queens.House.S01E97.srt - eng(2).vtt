WEBVTT

00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.237
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan blackmailed me...

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:08.007
into spying on Ms. Choi Ja Young and Designer Kang Jae In.

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:12.407
He told me to steal her designs,

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:16.077
but I told Designer Kang Jae In everything...

00:00:16.847 --> 00:00:19.647
and spied on Chairman Hwang Gi Chan instead.

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:23.487
I recorded him every time we met,

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:28.257
and everything I'm saying right now is backed up by evidence.

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:34.337
So I was the one being spied on all along?

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.567
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan is behind the fraud case...

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:41.777
and the false sexual assault accusation.

00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:48.977
Well, I am...

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:53.187
a lawyer who has worked here since Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol's day.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.687
I was Ms. Choi Ja Young's lawyer in her case,

00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:00.027
but on Chairman Hwang's orders,

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.857
I swindled Ms. Choi Ja Young out of her entire fortune...

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:07.027
and handed it all over to him.

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:10.597
- What? Hwang Gi Chan again? - What? What is this?

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:14.477
That's crazy.

00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:18.277
I am the employee...

00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:21.377
who wrongly accused Director Kim Do Yun of sexual assault.

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:22.877
(Director Kim Do Yun)

00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:25.447
Kang Jae In convinced me to come forward today,

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:30.017
and the one who ordered me to frame Kim Do Yun as a sex offender...

00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:33.187
was also Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:38.267
There's also a video that's a lead on Chairman Hwang's embezzlement.

00:01:40.427 --> 00:01:43.167
My name is Hwang Gi Man,

00:01:43.237 --> 00:01:47.207
and I'm the older brother of YL's chairman, Hwang Gi Chan.

00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:53.077
I borrowed money from many people, claiming it was for investments,

00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:55.677
and most of that money...

00:01:56.247 --> 00:01:59.317
was paid back by my younger brother, Hwang Gi Chan.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:03.257
But I doubt he had that kind of cash lying around.

00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:07.597
I wonder if he dipped into the company's funds.

00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:11.797
Where did he get the money...

00:02:12.297 --> 00:02:14.597
to keep paying off his brother's massive debts?

00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:17.467
Could it be that he dipped into company funds?

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:21.037
The statements in Hwang Gi Man's video expose...

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:23.137
were also true.

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:30.817
Regarding the establishment of the overseas factory,

00:02:31.287 --> 00:02:34.217
I had to resign over allegations of a double contract.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:36.717
I'm sure you all remember that incident.

00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:41.627
The culprit is none other than Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

00:02:41.797 --> 00:02:44.797
(YL Group Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting)

00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:48.097
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan used H and K Company,

00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:51.237
a partner company for the overseas factory project,

00:02:51.407 --> 00:02:53.667
to embezzle company funds and create a slush fund,

00:02:54.437 --> 00:02:57.477
and then he framed me for it.

00:02:59.407 --> 00:03:01.247
H and K Company...

00:03:01.617 --> 00:03:04.487
was involved as a partner...

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:06.417
in most of Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's projects,

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:10.717
and we've also secured evidence of dirty money funnelled through it.

00:03:12.327 --> 00:03:15.557
Just knowing who Catherine is, the CEO of H and K Company,

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:17.397
makes the picture clear.

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:22.337
Catherine is Chairman Hwang's mistress-turned-wife,

00:03:23.797 --> 00:03:24.807
Kang Se Ri.

00:03:26.537 --> 00:03:27.567
That's not true!

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.047
I've had enough of these lies. There's a limit to your slander!

00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:33.747
Do you have any proof that I'm Catherine?

00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:35.377
You don't have any!

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:41.787
Why not tell them, Secretary Yoon? You're his right-hand man.

00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:50.057
Catherine, CEO of H and K Company, is indeed Kang Se Ri.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.267
While I was working as secretary to Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.067
I overheard them discussing H and K Company...

00:03:56.337 --> 00:03:57.537
countless times.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.237
I am a witness.

00:04:02.237 --> 00:04:03.837
Even if I am Catherine,

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:08.417
that's not proof that Chairman Hwang embezzled money via H and K Company!

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:10.447
H and K Company...

00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:13.087
is a legitimate partner of the YL Group!

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:15.357
Do you have the double contract?

00:04:16.087 --> 00:04:18.027
If you're going to talk nonsense about having seen it...

00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:21.197
Then have a look.

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:30.097
Proof of Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's embezzlement via H and K Company,

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:31.767
the double contract.

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:34.007
I told you.

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:37.237
That I would find it, no matter what.

00:04:43.847 --> 00:04:47.247
The first to discover this truth and launch an investigation...

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:51.057
was the victim of the hit-and-run accident.

00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:54.227
Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee.

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:56.527
My sister.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.037
The one who killed my sister, Do Hee, in that hit-and-run...

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.867
was that man, Hwang Gi Chan.

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:08.177
That's not true.

00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:11.507
- Tell them it's not true, Honey! - As the victim's family,

00:05:12.347 --> 00:05:15.677
we've already secured and submitted key evidence to the authorities,

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.647
and an investigation into Hwang Gi Chan is now underway.

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:22.787
If you had concrete evidence, he would've been arrested by now.

00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:24.787
But that's not the case, is it?

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.727
The investigation is a matter for the authorities.

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:30.327
Let's proceed with what we're here to do.

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:33.097
Yes. In that case,

00:05:34.027 --> 00:05:37.767
we will now vote on the motion to dismiss Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:49.277
(YL Group Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting)

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:52.517
As a result of the vote, the motion to dismiss Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

00:05:52.587 --> 00:05:53.917
(Chairman Park Dong Heon)

00:05:54.017 --> 00:05:55.157
has passed.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:24.047
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:06:46.107 --> 00:06:50.377
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:34.987
Your Jae In obsession blinded you. And look! This is what it's come to.

00:07:35.617 --> 00:07:36.887
I told you to be prepared for this!

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.327
I told you to do whatever it takes not to lose this seat,

00:07:40.657 --> 00:07:42.227
that you had to protect it!

00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:43.997
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:07:44.257 --> 00:07:45.367
You don't know?

00:07:45.427 --> 00:07:48.897
Do whatever it takes to get it back!

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:52.037
- I guess it wasn't meant for me. - It is yours!

00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:55.977
It's our company! The one we took over together!

00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:00.707
I couldn't see it when I was blinded.

00:08:02.717 --> 00:08:04.747
But now that my desperation is gone,

00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:08.287
everything is clear, as if a fog has lifted.

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:12.087
Now I finally see everything.

00:08:13.257 --> 00:08:16.357
I thought you kept telling me to take over YL Group for my sake.

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.497
But it was all for you.

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:20.667
To satisfy your own greed.

00:08:21.297 --> 00:08:22.497
You needed me in this position.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:26.667
- You just needed me, Hwang Gi Chan. - That's not true.

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:30.807
It's because I love you that I want you to be at the top.

00:08:31.447 --> 00:08:33.177
Why can't you understand how I feel?

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:37.547
- Stop it. It's already over. - It's not over.

00:08:37.987 --> 00:08:39.217
How can it be over?

00:08:39.587 --> 00:08:42.387
Think about Ji Ho! Your son, Ji Ho!

00:08:46.857 --> 00:08:48.297
I'll take care of Ji Ho's future on my own.

00:08:48.957 --> 00:08:50.027
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:53.197
Right! I knew you'd have a plan.

00:08:53.997 --> 00:08:55.767
There's no way you'd lose everything just like this.

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:58.437
You can't, especially for Ji Ho's sake.

00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:00.737
I'm counting on you.

00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:05.407
Get out.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:11.487
Jae In, we finally did it. This was all you.

00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:13.887
You were a huge help too.

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.516
The double contract was the smoking gun.

00:09:16.517 --> 00:09:18.987
The credit goes to Ms. Kim Do Hee, not me.

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:22.927
The old me would've just deleted it without knowing what it was.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.697
I feel like Ms. Kim put her trust in me.

00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:30.397
This was a group effort from you two and everyone else.

00:09:34.237 --> 00:09:35.237
Jae In.

00:09:35.537 --> 00:09:38.907
While you prepare for the election of the new chairman,

00:09:39.047 --> 00:09:42.077
think about how you're going to lead YL Group...

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:43.917
and just prepare yourself for what's to come.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.417
If Jae In can't be chair right away, the post will be empty. What then?

00:09:49.017 --> 00:09:51.357
We'll be in emergency management for the time being.

00:09:54.127 --> 00:09:56.057
Until the new chairman is inaugurated,

00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:59.567
I'll take full responsibility and make sure no problems arise.

00:09:59.697 --> 00:10:01.967
So don't worry about a thing and just focus on your work.

00:10:02.397 --> 00:10:03.937
Okay, I will.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:07.437
I'm glad the motion to dismiss Chairman Hwang Gi Chan passed.

00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:10.877
I was worried, but I'm relieved it went smoothly.

00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:14.577
We've only clipped the wings of Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

00:10:15.117 --> 00:10:16.747
What comes next is what's truly important.

00:10:17.747 --> 00:10:21.317
To take them down completely, H and K Company is still a problem.

00:10:22.617 --> 00:10:25.957
That's right. Even with H and K Company's slush fund,

00:10:26.027 --> 00:10:27.557
those two will be able to live comfortably.

00:10:28.257 --> 00:10:31.897
We have to find a way to cut off H and K Company's cash flow.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:34.527
There must be a way.

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.207
I believe I may have found it.

00:10:44.747 --> 00:10:47.047
- When did you get here? - Just now.

00:10:47.177 --> 00:10:50.747
You rushed out of town yesterday. Did everything go well?

00:10:51.987 --> 00:10:53.017
Yes.

00:10:54.017 --> 00:10:55.887
Didn't you say you thought you found a way?

00:10:59.287 --> 00:11:02.097
Today, YL Group's chairman Hwang Gi Chan has been dismissed.

00:11:02.797 --> 00:11:05.327
Following a series of reputational risks involving its owner,

00:11:05.427 --> 00:11:08.097
and with Chairman Hwang named a suspect in numerous crimes,

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.197
YL Group stated he could no longer be trusted in his position.

00:11:11.237 --> 00:11:14.467
The group called it a drastic corporate measure.

00:11:16.837 --> 00:11:20.247
What? Who do they think they are, firing the chairman, the top dog?

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.517
Just one after another. What is all this?

00:11:30.317 --> 00:11:34.727
Gi Chan was fired as chairman. As his secretary, I was fired too.

00:11:34.897 --> 00:11:36.557
And apparently, our sister-in-law was fired too.

00:11:37.257 --> 00:11:39.297
They're a married couple, so they're a package deal too.

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:44.067
You all came home jobless the same day the chairman was fired?

00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:47.136
They fire you, and you just take it?

00:11:47.137 --> 00:11:48.637
You should've refused to leave!

00:11:48.737 --> 00:11:51.647
- You should have held your ground! - Holding our ground wouldn't work.

00:11:52.907 --> 00:11:54.677
It would've just been pathetic.

00:11:55.377 --> 00:11:59.087
Who cares if it gets ugly? You think people in high places...

00:11:59.147 --> 00:12:01.247
got there by playing nice?

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:05.027
Getting your hands dirty is nothing if you want to keep your money.

00:12:05.227 --> 00:12:09.297
Even if I'm not the chairman, I'll provide for you and the family,

00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:10.397
so don't worry.

00:12:10.697 --> 00:12:13.167
Don't be like that. Just go back there right now and...

00:12:13.227 --> 00:12:14.467
I'm back.

00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:20.807
Should I leave and come back in?

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.507
No, it's fine. Get some rest.

00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:31.717
Oh, I'm so frustrated! My gosh.

00:12:32.047 --> 00:12:33.987
What am I going to do?

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:37.887
Oh, I'm just so frustrated.

00:12:43.427 --> 00:12:44.597
I'm so glad your father...

00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:48.337
can finally rest in peace.

00:12:49.637 --> 00:12:52.407
Mom, just wait a little longer.

00:12:53.137 --> 00:12:56.737
I'm going to get back everything that Hwang and Kang Se Ri took.

00:12:57.207 --> 00:13:01.347
Not just the company, but the house and the gallery.

00:13:02.017 --> 00:13:04.647
Jae In. I'm scared.

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:09.017
I'm terrified of what Kang Se Ri might do to you.

00:13:09.957 --> 00:13:11.487
If you get hurt like that too...

00:13:13.557 --> 00:13:16.757
Like what? Mom, what are you talking about?

00:13:18.267 --> 00:13:20.997
It's nothing. You don't need to know.

00:13:21.737 --> 00:13:25.307
Did Kang Se Ri threaten you? Did she threaten to kill me?

00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:28.507
Mom, don't let her get to you.

00:13:30.007 --> 00:13:32.777
I'm not going to die. That will absolutely never happen.

00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:37.647
Look at me now. I got the company back on my own.

00:13:38.587 --> 00:13:41.887
- But still... - What did Kang Se Ri say to you?

00:13:43.157 --> 00:13:45.157
How can I be careful if I don't know what she said?

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.157
Hwang Gi Man getting hurt.

00:13:51.027 --> 00:13:52.197
I saw it.

00:13:53.027 --> 00:13:56.267
Him, lying at the bottom of the stairs, covered in blood.

00:13:57.167 --> 00:13:58.307
Kang Se Ri...

00:14:01.677 --> 00:14:03.877
The accident Hwang Gi Man had on the stairs...

00:14:04.437 --> 00:14:05.577
was Kang Se Ri's doing?

00:14:10.647 --> 00:14:13.547
Mom, tell me everything.

00:14:19.887 --> 00:14:20.887
I'm hungry.

00:14:22.797 --> 00:14:25.327
Jae In. When did you get here?

00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:29.197
We should have dinner. Let's eat together.

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:42.417
Oh Seong, what are you doing? I said, don't bring her here again!

00:14:43.747 --> 00:14:44.747
Yun Hee.

00:14:46.587 --> 00:14:47.587
I'm sorry.

00:14:53.387 --> 00:14:57.497
We even registered our marriage. We're legally a married couple now.

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:01.737
I cleaned out the small room for you to use, and this is what you do?

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:04.497
Why ask if you'll do what you want?

00:15:04.897 --> 00:15:06.637
You're married. Get your own place.

00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:10.007
- Why did you move in here? - It was my idea.

00:15:10.707 --> 00:15:13.907
I wanted to be closer to you and learn to run a household.

00:15:13.977 --> 00:15:16.047
And I wanted to live together as a family.

00:15:18.077 --> 00:15:21.447
I also want to make up for my past mistakes.

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:25.257
I don't want to hear it. Just stop talking and leave.

00:15:28.897 --> 00:15:31.457
Grandma, what's wrong?

00:15:37.997 --> 00:15:39.437
I'll let it slide for today since she's here.

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:42.307
But pack your bags and get out tomorrow. Both of you.

00:15:43.707 --> 00:15:44.707
Bo Ram.

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:48.047
It's nothing. Come on, let's go to bed.

00:15:48.517 --> 00:15:49.517
Okay.

00:15:54.647 --> 00:15:55.817
Are you sure you're okay?

00:15:56.387 --> 00:15:59.327
We could move out, as she suggested.

00:16:00.057 --> 00:16:04.297
What are you talking about? I said I'll stay till she approves.

00:16:07.127 --> 00:16:10.537
This time, I'm going to prove my sincerity to her.

00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:13.167
So,

00:16:13.607 --> 00:16:14.807
where's our room?

00:16:19.377 --> 00:16:23.947
Goodness, all this registered mail? What is all this?

00:16:27.547 --> 00:16:30.457
From Kim Do Yun of DH Holdings for false accusation,

00:16:30.487 --> 00:16:32.987
assault, and a claim for damages?

00:16:33.757 --> 00:16:34.827
Let me see.

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:40.627
Is this from YL Group too?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.697
For the new business group...

00:16:43.837 --> 00:16:46.507
and repayment of personal loans,

00:16:46.837 --> 00:16:49.337
and a penalty fee for damaging the group's reputation?

00:16:50.507 --> 00:16:53.777
They're just after your money, aren't they?

00:16:55.277 --> 00:16:56.947
What's all the commotion about this morning?

00:17:03.417 --> 00:17:05.887
This wasn't planned overnight to take you down.

00:17:06.687 --> 00:17:09.497
They planned to send certifications, the criminal complaint,

00:17:09.857 --> 00:17:12.297
and even demand letters for payment. They sent everything at once.

00:17:15.337 --> 00:17:16.397
Watch your mouth.

00:17:20.337 --> 00:17:22.077
It seems your hands are full.

00:17:22.477 --> 00:17:24.577
I almost feel bad for just going about my own business.

00:17:25.747 --> 00:17:30.077
Not at all. When will the gallery pieces sell?

00:17:31.577 --> 00:17:36.257
I'll know after the appraisal. I'll set a time with the buyer...

00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:39.027
and get the ball rolling right away. Well, then.

00:17:40.557 --> 00:17:41.857
Oh, dear, what are we going to do?

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.397
What are we going to do?

00:17:45.127 --> 00:17:48.997
The art money will cover us for now. So don't worry.

00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:52.137
Follow me.

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:58.947
Withdraw the entire slush fund from the H and K Company account.

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.006
All of it?

00:18:00.007 --> 00:18:03.117
They're already onto us. If they start tracing the account,

00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:07.547
the funds will freeze, and we're done. Even if we sell the art to fix it,

00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:09.687
we still need money to live on.

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:12.387
It's all been withdrawn?

00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:17.897
What did you do? Catherine, it says you withdrew it.

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:21.097
- It wasn't me. - What do you mean, it wasn't you?

00:18:21.597 --> 00:18:23.837
It says right here the withdrawal was made under your name, Catherine.

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:25.067
It must be some kind of error.

00:18:25.407 --> 00:18:27.507
Yes, there has to be a mistake.

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:29.437
I'll check when the US banks open.

00:18:29.737 --> 00:18:32.007
I can't confirm anything until then.

00:18:39.917 --> 00:18:42.657
So we hit them with the complaint and the works first thing?

00:18:42.757 --> 00:18:46.487
Of course. We at DH Holdings gave them our all.

00:18:47.887 --> 00:18:50.797
The legal fees to handle all those lawsuits alone will be astronomical.

00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:57.067
Good morning.

00:18:57.497 --> 00:19:00.037
About the second round... Did everything go okay?

00:19:01.207 --> 00:19:03.507
Yes, I confirmed the deposit.

00:19:03.907 --> 00:19:07.107
Please tell your sister I said thank you.

00:19:08.077 --> 00:19:09.517
I found Catherine.

00:19:10.077 --> 00:19:12.687
So you're saying you found the real Catherine?

00:19:13.387 --> 00:19:15.857
Yes. My sister, Catherine.

00:19:16.957 --> 00:19:19.157
I never imagined she was in Korea,

00:19:19.787 --> 00:19:21.057
but she was here all along.

00:19:22.057 --> 00:19:23.857
It looks like she was in a serious accident.

00:19:24.927 --> 00:19:27.167
She's been hospitalized at a state-run facility,

00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:29.637
and she's woken up.

00:19:30.067 --> 00:19:31.737
I thought you two were separated as children.

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.407
Are you sure it's your sister?

00:19:34.237 --> 00:19:35.677
We did a DNA test.

00:19:36.107 --> 00:19:37.337
She's my sister.

00:19:39.347 --> 00:19:40.407
Congratulations.

00:19:41.207 --> 00:19:44.417
You missed your sister so much. I'm so glad you found her.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:51.087
The key to cutting off H and K Company's funding.

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.657
My sister holds the key.

00:19:54.657 --> 00:19:58.097
If I can get power of attorney from Catherine,

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:00.967
I should be able to take control of H and K Company, right?

00:20:03.397 --> 00:20:04.437
That's right.

00:20:05.097 --> 00:20:09.207
Because Kang Se Ri is using the name of your sister, Catherine.

00:20:09.507 --> 00:20:14.207
All that Se Ri built as Catherine, the real Catherine can take it all.

00:20:16.617 --> 00:20:20.017
I'll have my lawyer get on it right away.

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:23.857
It seems like you really are my Lady Luck, Jae In.

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.857
After meeting you, things worked out eight years ago,

00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:31.427
and this time, I found my son,

00:20:32.127 --> 00:20:34.067
and I was even able to find my sister.

00:20:34.697 --> 00:20:37.297
- Thank you. - I hardly did anything.

00:20:37.637 --> 00:20:40.567
I'm the lucky one for meeting you, Teo.

00:20:41.437 --> 00:20:44.777
But the assets were all accumulated in your sister's name.

00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:46.507
Are you sure you want to give it all to me?

00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:49.647
As long as it's used to punish those terrible people,

00:20:50.217 --> 00:20:51.617
I'm more than okay with it.

00:20:52.387 --> 00:20:55.317
And to be precise, it's YL Group's money, isn't it?

00:21:03.157 --> 00:21:06.027
So we have one last KO punch left, right?

00:21:07.427 --> 00:21:10.867
That's right. Time for our player to enter the ring.

00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:13.367
I'm all in on you, Teo.

00:21:14.637 --> 00:21:15.637
Me too.

00:21:18.207 --> 00:21:20.347
And you, Director Kim Do Yun? Are you not placing a bet?

00:21:23.677 --> 00:21:26.187
Of course, I'm betting on you too, Teo.

00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:29.057
You almost hurt my feelings.

00:21:30.817 --> 00:21:31.887
All right then,

00:21:32.227 --> 00:21:33.927
let's step into the ring.

00:21:41.097 --> 00:21:42.437
She's alive?

00:21:43.597 --> 00:21:45.067
Why now, of all times?

00:21:46.567 --> 00:21:48.167
What's going on? What did they say?

00:21:49.037 --> 00:21:51.977
They say the real Catherine is alive.

00:21:52.347 --> 00:21:54.107
Catherine withdrew all the money.

00:21:54.477 --> 00:21:55.817
What are you talking about?

00:21:56.617 --> 00:21:58.377
Isn't your English name Catherine?

00:22:02.957 --> 00:22:03.987
Don't tell me...

00:22:04.717 --> 00:22:06.527
you've been using a stolen identity?

00:22:07.387 --> 00:22:08.427
Is that it?

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.557
There must be some kind of mistake.

00:22:12.827 --> 00:22:15.637
How could someone who's been gone for over 20 years just...

00:22:16.897 --> 00:22:18.037
Lee Teo?

00:22:20.407 --> 00:22:21.407
Lee Teo?

00:22:23.777 --> 00:22:24.937
What's that supposed to mean?

00:22:25.847 --> 00:22:28.177
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan, where are you?

00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:38.827
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:39.457 --> 00:22:42.997
That's what I'd like to ask you. How could you deceive me?

00:22:43.727 --> 00:22:45.097
Do you take me for a fool?

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:46.997
Chairman, I never would've expected this from you.

00:22:47.297 --> 00:22:49.697
How could you even think of selling me forgeries?

00:22:50.367 --> 00:22:53.807
Were you trying to tarnish my reputation and my career?

00:22:54.867 --> 00:22:57.237
Why don't you start by explaining what on earth you're talking about?

00:22:57.777 --> 00:22:58.847
What do you mean, forgeries?

00:22:59.107 --> 00:23:00.977
The pieces you handed over to me,

00:23:01.307 --> 00:23:04.177
they're all forgeries!

00:23:12.187 --> 00:23:13.627
(Appraisal Report)

00:23:13.957 --> 00:23:18.297
The paintings at JY Gallery he owns are actually worth a fortune.

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:22.267
He heavily invested in paintings to create a slush fund.

00:23:23.137 --> 00:23:26.637
So now, what he will get back won't be valuable paintings...

00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:29.007
but worthless scraps of paper.

00:23:29.877 --> 00:23:32.247
- What do we do? - We have to switch them.

00:23:33.447 --> 00:23:36.847
By swapping, you mean replacing them with forgeries?

00:23:37.447 --> 00:23:42.087
Yes. We'll return them to the true owner.

00:23:43.657 --> 00:23:45.827
No. They can't be forgeries.

00:23:46.587 --> 00:23:49.457
I had appraisers confirm their authenticity.

00:23:50.797 --> 00:23:53.797
Hey, what's all the commotion? I can't even take a nap.

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:59.167
I had the country's best appraisers double-check this result for me.

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:00.867
I couldn't believe it myself.

00:24:08.577 --> 00:24:12.647
If you are right, Chairman, then everyone else here is lying.

00:24:13.087 --> 00:24:16.817
Why not get them appraised yourself to see if I'm lying?

00:24:16.957 --> 00:24:18.087
That would be better, wouldn't it?

00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:25.727
Appraisals this, double that... What does any of it mean?

00:24:26.897 --> 00:24:28.467
He's saying all the paintings are fakes.

00:24:29.397 --> 00:24:30.797
What?

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:33.207
My goodness. What is all this nonsense?

00:24:33.537 --> 00:24:35.337
What do you mean, fakes?

00:24:36.137 --> 00:24:38.207
Are you telling me all my paintings are fakes?

00:24:38.707 --> 00:24:42.717
Are you saying these have no value, just worthless scraps of paper?

00:24:42.847 --> 00:24:43.847
Yes.

00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:47.917
Are you an art dealer or what? You're a con artist, aren't you?

00:24:48.717 --> 00:24:51.517
After all that talk about selling paintings worth millions of dollars.

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:54.557
There's having a bad eye for art, and then there's this.

00:24:54.957 --> 00:24:56.157
Mother, that's enough.

00:24:56.527 --> 00:25:00.267
Darn it! How can you stand there and take it?

00:25:00.927 --> 00:25:02.597
There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

00:25:03.197 --> 00:25:06.367
All the pieces are authentic. I even have the authenticity certificates.

00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:09.607
Did it ever occur to you that the certificates could be forgeries?

00:25:10.877 --> 00:25:12.807
Regardless of whether they're real or not, one thing is certain.

00:25:13.247 --> 00:25:17.247
I can no longer sell the paintings you entrusted to me, Chairman Hwang.

00:25:17.517 --> 00:25:19.017
There's an issue of trust.

00:25:19.987 --> 00:25:21.347
First, just give me some time.

00:25:22.587 --> 00:25:24.187
I'll look into it myself.

00:25:29.257 --> 00:25:33.067
Oh, my gosh. What is happening? Oh, dear.

00:25:33.227 --> 00:25:36.497
Oh, my head. Oh, dear.

00:25:37.367 --> 00:25:38.437
Oh, my.

00:25:38.697 --> 00:25:41.667
No, I just... Oh, dear.

00:25:56.917 --> 00:26:00.557
I'm going to tear you to shreds.

00:26:01.487 --> 00:26:03.397
Don't you dare think you'll die a peaceful death.

00:26:03.727 --> 00:26:05.627
You don't deserve to die like that.

00:26:07.527 --> 00:26:09.197
I won't let you go that easily.

00:26:10.467 --> 00:26:13.237
You're so confident you know everything, aren't you?

00:26:14.737 --> 00:26:16.677
You're probably convinced you have it all figured out.

00:26:17.337 --> 00:26:18.607
But is that really true?

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:21.677
That's just your delusion and arrogance.

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.917
To me, the one who loved you,

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:28.387
to my family, and to my dad,

00:26:28.817 --> 00:26:30.157
and to our Eun Ho!

00:26:30.617 --> 00:26:32.527
Look at what you've done.

00:26:33.557 --> 00:26:35.187
So you were just a piece of trash all along.

00:26:36.257 --> 00:26:38.057
I'm going to throw you in the trash where you belong,

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:39.797
so you just wait.

00:27:09.397 --> 00:27:12.427
H and K Company. That was your doing, wasn't it?

00:27:13.397 --> 00:27:15.297
Catherine is your sister, isn't she?

00:27:15.627 --> 00:27:16.637
What are you talking about?

00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:19.167
Catherine withdrew all the money from my account!

00:27:19.667 --> 00:27:20.807
Have you found Catherine?

00:27:21.207 --> 00:27:22.207
Have you?

00:27:22.477 --> 00:27:25.637
- Where's Catherine? Where is she? - Kang Se Ri.

00:27:26.147 --> 00:27:28.977
If it's Catherine's account, then it's her money.

00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:30.517
How can you call it yours?

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:33.787
So it was your doing all along, wasn't it?

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:37.157
Was that you with the paintings, too?

00:27:38.587 --> 00:27:40.987
Why on earth would you do all this?

00:27:42.187 --> 00:27:43.597
Is this because of Kang Jae In?

00:27:45.127 --> 00:27:47.327
What does Kang Jae In have to do with me?

00:27:48.467 --> 00:27:51.137
I'm suing you for fraudulently using my sister's name,

00:27:51.497 --> 00:27:53.367
so you'd better get yourself an expensive lawyer.

00:28:00.177 --> 00:28:01.307
What am I going to do?

00:28:01.977 --> 00:28:03.777
What do I do? What am I going to do?

00:28:06.687 --> 00:28:08.817
After all I've been through to become Kang Jae In.

00:28:09.557 --> 00:28:11.257
I can't let it all fall apart like this.

00:28:13.657 --> 00:28:15.957
Money. I need money.

00:28:20.727 --> 00:28:21.767
That's it.

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:23.537
This house.

00:28:26.107 --> 00:28:27.707
I know I put it on the market for a quick sale,

00:28:28.067 --> 00:28:30.837
but I didn't expect a buyer to turn up so quickly.

00:28:31.407 --> 00:28:33.307
It's a prime location, isn't it?

00:28:34.347 --> 00:28:37.477
By the way, the buyer's rep will be handling the contract.

00:28:37.977 --> 00:28:40.247
The actual buyer is currently living overseas.

00:28:40.787 --> 00:28:44.817
You said the buyer is Anna Wang, a Chinese-American, right?

00:28:45.087 --> 00:28:46.087
That's right.

00:28:46.527 --> 00:28:49.697
I hear she's an investor with massive cash reserves.

00:28:52.357 --> 00:28:54.267
(Number One Jackpot Real Estate Office)

00:28:56.467 --> 00:28:57.767
(Cashier's check: 5.5 million dollars)

00:28:57.837 --> 00:28:58.837
All right.

00:28:59.867 --> 00:29:02.237
Gi Chan is all washed up now anyway.

00:29:03.077 --> 00:29:05.807
Ji Ho and I need to survive with this money, at the very least.

00:29:09.817 --> 00:29:11.347
Ma'am, this check is a forgery.

00:29:11.617 --> 00:29:13.387
It was never issued by our bank.

00:29:14.487 --> 00:29:15.487
What?

00:29:18.587 --> 00:29:19.887
My money.

00:29:20.827 --> 00:29:23.297
(Daeyang Bank)

00:29:37.277 --> 00:29:39.607
Give me my money! My five million dollars!

00:29:39.907 --> 00:29:41.677
Give it to me now! Right now!

00:29:43.947 --> 00:29:47.587
What are you doing? I owe you nothing. Why the scene?

00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:49.757
Where is he?

00:29:50.017 --> 00:29:52.387
I'm not talking about you! There was someone else working here!

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:54.487
If you mean the part-timer,

00:29:54.787 --> 00:29:56.757
he quit just a little while ago. He said something came up.

00:29:57.657 --> 00:29:59.627
No way. You're lying.

00:29:59.967 --> 00:30:02.867
You think I don't know you're all in on this scam together?

00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:04.567
Don't accuse an innocent person.

00:30:05.067 --> 00:30:07.337
Look, I don't know anything, so just leave.

00:30:07.437 --> 00:30:09.737
I'm not leaving until I get my money back!

00:30:10.107 --> 00:30:11.577
Go get my money!

00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:13.977
I said, go get it right now!

00:30:14.947 --> 00:30:15.947
Good grief.

00:30:17.277 --> 00:30:20.417
Then call the police! Let's do this by the book!

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:25.017
I don't know the first thing about this,

00:30:25.387 --> 00:30:26.427
so let's do this by the book!

00:30:50.317 --> 00:30:52.787
The sellers insist they're authentic and have proof of authenticity,

00:30:53.447 --> 00:30:55.117
so we'll have to compare them to the originals.

00:30:55.817 --> 00:30:57.457
This probably won't be resolved anytime soon.

00:30:59.627 --> 00:31:02.457
I think you'll need to find a place to stay, like a hotel or somewhere.

00:31:03.497 --> 00:31:05.027
Wouldn't that be easier for both of us?

00:31:06.597 --> 00:31:07.597
Fine.

00:31:07.997 --> 00:31:09.497
But before that, I have something to say.

00:31:20.677 --> 00:31:23.047
(Petition for Paternity Confirmation and Custody)

00:31:30.457 --> 00:31:31.887
You're Ji Ho's...

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.957
So you knew Ji Ho wasn't your biological son.

00:31:36.497 --> 00:31:37.757
Then that makes things easier.

00:31:38.127 --> 00:31:39.127
Yes.

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:41.027
Ji Ho is my son.

00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:44.567
And I'm taking him with me.

00:31:48.737 --> 00:31:50.877
However, since it seems you've fallen on hard times,

00:31:51.907 --> 00:31:54.277
if you'd like, as a token of thanks for raising him all this time,

00:31:55.447 --> 00:31:57.247
I am willing to offer you financial support.

00:32:00.587 --> 00:32:01.787
I don't need your support.

00:32:03.117 --> 00:32:04.557
You may be his biological father,

00:32:05.787 --> 00:32:06.987
but Ji Ho is my son.

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:11.357
I came to this house for one reason.

00:32:12.457 --> 00:32:15.367
It was to see if my son, Ji Ho, was in a good home...

00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:18.137
and to make sure he was growing up healthy.

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:21.307
If he was, I was planning to leave without any fuss.

00:32:24.637 --> 00:32:27.007
I'm well aware that you raised Ji Ho as your own son,

00:32:28.277 --> 00:32:29.447
and that the only father he's ever known...

00:32:30.477 --> 00:32:32.787
is you, Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

00:32:35.847 --> 00:32:39.387
And yet, you still intend to tear a father and son apart?

00:32:40.127 --> 00:32:42.087
Haven't you seen Kang Se Ri for who she really is by now?

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:44.157
Being raised by a woman like that,

00:32:45.257 --> 00:32:46.997
do you think that's what's best for Ji Ho?

00:32:48.397 --> 00:32:50.297
If you truly love Ji Ho and have his best interests at heart,

00:32:51.937 --> 00:32:52.937
what's the right thing to do?

00:32:58.407 --> 00:33:00.507
I'll give you a few days if you need time to think,

00:33:01.507 --> 00:33:03.617
but once we go to court, I have no intention of backing down.

00:33:05.177 --> 00:33:06.187
I've said my piece.

00:33:18.227 --> 00:33:19.227
Hwang Gi Chan.

00:33:20.897 --> 00:33:23.067
What in the world do you really know about Kang Se Ri?

00:33:40.317 --> 00:33:42.017
What do you think you're doing here?

00:33:42.287 --> 00:33:43.587
Who let you in?

00:33:43.857 --> 00:33:44.857
I did.

00:33:45.657 --> 00:33:47.087
None of you has even packed your things.

00:33:47.787 --> 00:33:49.497
What are you all still doing in my house?

00:33:50.657 --> 00:33:53.597
What are you talking about? How is this your house? It's ours!

00:33:54.167 --> 00:33:55.167
Noh Sook Ja,

00:33:55.927 --> 00:33:57.737
I take it you didn't know your daughter-in-law sold the house?

00:34:03.677 --> 00:34:04.677
What?

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:07.847
- What are you talking about? - No...

00:34:14.087 --> 00:34:16.887
Now that we're all clear, everyone get out of my house.

00:34:18.157 --> 00:34:19.157
Wait...

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:22.457
Gi Chan, hurry up and call Ji Ho's mother.

00:34:23.757 --> 00:34:24.827
I'm going to lose my mind.

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:26.967
Do you really have to go this far?

00:34:28.367 --> 00:34:29.397
This far?

00:34:30.437 --> 00:34:32.837
Hwang Gi Chan, and just how far did you go with what you did to me?

00:34:33.737 --> 00:34:34.967
If you don't want to be dragged out,

00:34:35.637 --> 00:34:37.037
get out of my house right now.

00:34:38.277 --> 00:34:42.077
No way! Who says it's your house? That contract is null and void!

00:34:43.217 --> 00:34:46.017
Drag all of this trash out of my house.

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.187
And every last one of their belongings too!

00:35:37.797 --> 00:35:41.667
(Queen's House)

00:35:41.737 --> 00:35:44.006
Drag all of this trash out of my house.

00:35:44.007 --> 00:35:46.037
And every last one of their belongings too!

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:49.717
The buyer's name is Kang Jae In?

00:35:50.817 --> 00:35:52.847
Are you really not hiding a single thing from me?

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:54.917
Nothing, I swear!

00:35:55.217 --> 00:35:56.587
Whose son Ji Ho is...

00:35:57.487 --> 00:35:58.817
Do I have to be the one to say it?

00:35:59.217 --> 00:36:00.287
Is something wrong?

00:36:00.627 --> 00:36:03.027
It's Hwang Gi Chan. He has terminal stomach cancer.

00:36:03.457 --> 00:36:06.097
A year left to live, at most.

00:36:06.467 --> 00:36:07.467
Dad.

00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:10.437
The house you left for me.

00:36:11.737 --> 00:36:12.867
I've finally gotten it back.
